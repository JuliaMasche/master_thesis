They are extremely useful mathematical models to describe physical observations we can make. Other posters have aptly explained the atomic model.  Gravity, too, is very much a theory; no gravity waves have even been detected, but we have a very useful model that describes much of the behavior on objects by this thing we _call_ gravity.  Gravity, however, is _not_ a fact.  It is a theoretical model used to talk about how objects behave in our physical environment.  Newton thought gravity was a simple vector force; Einstein a wave. Both are very useful models that have no religious overtones or requirements of faith, unless of course you want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly the way the theory now formulated talks about it.  That takes a great leap of faith, which, of course, is what religion takes.

But once you make a decision on the value of truth, and the likelihood of science getting it, the rest follows.  In your example, science is necessarily worthless, and so are its results, because truth is worthless, assuming that's all science is good for.

But I don't use it in the second sense.  Consider that F=ma is no different than F=$3 until I note the connection with reality that F=ma has, and F=$3 does not.  I'm making a decision as to the importance of F=ma over other expressions I can compute.  I'm valuing it, whether implicitly or directly, because I'm saying that things that have a basis in reality are different to other things which do not.  And _no-one_ points out an _unimportant_ difference, _except_ to say that it's unimportant.

No, actually organic chemists were among the first chemists to use modern MO theories for explaining reactions that did not fit into the old models. In synthetic organic chemistry, which still comprises a large part of organic chemistry, it is indeed common to ignore the rest of the molecule and pay attention only to the functional groups, but I think this, too, has changed with the advent of molecular modelling and asymmetric synthesis.

So this abortion-rejecting health-care market might be much smaller than one would think. 	But never underestimate the willingness of some professed opponents of abortion to get them. 	""If you are against abortion, DON'T HAVE ONE!"" 	goes one pro-choice slogan I once saw on someone's car (or was it a pickup truck?). I had been following an old railroad line that is to be used for a BART extension in South San Francisco, and I saw this car with this bumper sticker along the way. >As for someone suggesting that ""no one would be upset if I were >to give money to support women with crisis pregnancies, etc""  But >I have, having initiated and supported an ad in USC's student >newspaper regarding a Catholic health clinic offering assistance >to women in crisis pregnancies.  I've also devoted my life to a >consistent life ethic.

What have you done folks? 	Operation Rescue? Dennis Kriz, be aware of some of the company you keep. I'm talking about seriously militaristic right-wingers who would _love_ to execute those who provide and get abortions. Although there has been only one such assassination so far, I wonder how many other opponents of abortion would be willing to perform such assassinations if they could get away with it. -- /Loren Petrich, the Master Blaster /lip@s1.gov"	other

Since He will speak to those who have thought, surely He will speak to humankind, whose make-up and awareness are more comprehensive of all conscious beings.  Since He will speak to humankind, surely He will speak to the most perfect of mankind and those most worthy of address and highest in morality, and who are qualified to guide humanity; then He will certainly speak to Muhammad (SAW), who, as friend and foe alike testify, is of the highest character and morality, and who is obeyed by one fifth of humanity, to whose spiritual rule half of the globe has submitted, with the radiance of whose light has been illumined the future of mankind for thirteen centuries, to whom the believers, the luminous segment of humanity, renew their oath of allegiance five times a day, for whose happiness and peace they pray, for whom they call down Allah's blessings and bear admiration and love in their hearts.    Certainly, He will speak to Muhammad (SAW), and Indeed He has done so;  He will make him the Messenger, and Indeed He has done so; He will make him the guide for the rest of humanity, and Indeed He has done so. ----------------------------------------------------------------- To be continued In$a Allah.

Even if the readers have the slightest idea as to what the writer is referring to, it should be incumbent on Mr. Erwin to back up what he says with at least a concrete example of perhaps even a reference or two. (For example, ""Simon Zealotes"" = the certain apostle having a nickname connected to a Jewish terrorist group) 	Even Josephus fails to make the kind of broad brush reference to Christians made above - he is quite silent as to the fate of the Jewish Christian Church in Jerusalem, even though he took the time to record the death of St. James (brother of St. John). On the subject of the fate of Jesus's family, including James (the brother of Jesus) we learn nothing from Josephus. 	Likewise, Tacitus condemns the Jews as being a particularly vicious people, getting many of the facts about Jewish history wrong in the process. But even though Tactitus undoubtedly had the opportunity to learn much about the Christians during his tour in Asia Minor under Domitian, we find little to enlighten ourselves about the Christians in either the _Histories_ or the _Annals_ 	The writer's interpretation of _Acts_ is purely subjective as stated, and so one might expect him to elaborate a bit on just what aspects of ""cult psychology"" are to be found there. I can think of a thing or two offhand, but I'd like to give Mr. Erwin the opportunity to demonstrate his own knowledge satisfactorily before throwing out any more hints.

Unfortunately, he seems to be hoping for simplicity where it is not available. The lukewarm stew he detects may well be an inevitable result of the divine mixing himself up with a bunch of losers such as humanity. Also unfortunately (perhaps) I have a deadline in two weeks, the responsibility for which prevents me, in good conscience, from writing a more considered response and fully entering the fray, as it were. Let me then say what I can, briefly. ----- >The two commandments *are* rules; they are merely rules that are >so vague that they are practically devoid of meaning. This point, for the net.browsers who also still read books, is pursued throughly in Kaufmann, Critique_of_Religion_and_Philosophy. >The commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed, >in part, as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as if >he has ""ultimate responsibility."" This is a theological statement worthy of Barth. Dr Turpin (DD) may wear the black robe of Geneva yet! :-) >Indeed, many traditions present >an interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret >loving one's neighbor as following various other rules, and >relying on their god to make things come out right, precisely >because it would be wrong for man to assume such ""ultimate >responsibility."" Once again, we are confronted with good sounding >goo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean. This requires the assumption that all interpretations are equally valid, that there is no way of reasonably distinguishing among them. I wouldn't make that assumption; I don't think it is a reasonable assumption. >And who is to say that this interpretation is ""twisted""?  There >are many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward >reading show the Christian god behaving in just this way. Michael, and I, and others, read 'the Bible' with Christian glasses. Among the things that this should imply is that the NT informs the OT, even to the point of dominanting it. Some points in the OT (ceremonial & dietary laws) are explicitly abrogated by the NT texts. To drive Russell Turpin's point with adequacy, one needs to begin with NT texts (probably from Matthew, and probably about damnation) (Just trying to help :-) ) This part is, I discover, what most moves me to post: mls> I am a ""radical"" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously. >No, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel >seriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the >gospel. Russell Turpin's 'No' here is misplaced, not to say inappropriate. Michael's self-description much govern.  The equation of radical = liberal, which seems implied by Russell Turpin  is wrong.  Radical conservatives are possible (if sadly lacking in numbers at present).

Michael's question gets to a heart of the matter (Klingons have two hearts, so my metaphor is not mixed, just extraterrestrial :-) ) Russell Turpin (in an earlier post) had said that Michael (Michael's theological positions, actually) didn't tell him much about Christianity; Dean Simeon responds (this time gently): 'What do you mean?' More direct, perhaps, would have been: 'What could you possibly mean?' The implied rhetorical effort, to separate Michael from the tradition, is a failure. Michael is in the tradition.

How can one answer this while staying on the more general issue? I'm on the other side of the interpretive fence (from Michael) on this issue, yet '*nothing*' is a hideous overstatement. One verse is enough to refute it; I'll offer two, from Paul (of all people): 'In Jesus Christ there is neither male nor female...'(Galatians 3:28 {I don't quote single verses as a rule, and I don't carry them in my head}) and '*Nothing* shall separate us from the glory of God...' (roughly, from Romans).

Robert Weiss writes [a promise from Psalm 9:10] >Gee, since you wouldn't be at all hypocritical, you must be really >busy arguing against these out-of-context extracted translations! He directed a similar accusation of hypocrisy, again based on a lack of response to an article by Robert Weiss, toward Stephen. I pointed out that I did, in fact, agree that both Robert Weiss and Jim Meritt took quotes out of context.  Hence, I find it difficult to understand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite.  Needless to say, I don't have time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m. that takes a quote out of context. I asked Jim the following: >}So, according to you, Jim, the only way to criticize one person for >}taking a quote out of context, without being a hypocrite, is to post a >}response to *every* person on t.r.m who takes a quote out of context? Jim replied by saying >Did I either ask or assert that? But today we find four articles from Jim, one of which has the subject ""Silence is concurrence"": m23364@mwunix.mitre.org (James Meritt) writes: >Is it not the case that, in the eyes of the law, when someone is aware of >something and has the capability of taking action and does not, that individual >may be held responsible for that action? Which is, of course, a complete red herring.  Taking quotes out of context isn't a crime.  I don't have time to read every article on t.r.m., and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all. Does ""silence is concurrence"" imply that Jim thinks that because I didn't respond to Weiss' articles I must condone Weiss' taking quotes out of context?  Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this question; read what he has written and decide for yourself. But back to the context of my conversation with Jim.  Jim's next gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he concluded that I was being a hypocrite.  I challenged him to provide the details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion. Today we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn't help make it more clear, Jim), titled ""Inductive Logic"": >Scenario: >A white goose waddles past the door >A white goose waddles past the door >A white goose waddles past the door >...( repeat an uncountably large number of times)... >A black goose waddles past the door.

If ONLY black geese are observed to be axed, is it not a valid question >   to be concerned with the different behavior between black and white geese? More red herrings.  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large number of my articles?  Could Jim mean that because I ""axed"" his articles, but not Weiss' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ... Well, I can't see where he is going with this. But I can help him with his induction.  I've written roughly 80 articles since January.  The vast majority of them are discussions with Frank DeCenso and other inerrantists, where I take the position that they are making bad arguments.  Some are discussions with Jim Meritt where I take the position that he is making bad arguments (a straw man argument earlier, and taking quotes out of context more recently.) Think hard about this Jim.  See the pattern?  Think harder.  Run it through your induction engine and see what pops out. dj"	other

Keywords: Scripture, implication, prophesy, `Woof!' Organization: Rowan College of New Jersey Disclaimer: Brandy the WonderDog hopes his doghouse will be rebuilt. References: <1qh4m5INN2pu@ctron-news.ctron.com> Date: Thu, 22 Apr 1993 04:26:53 GMT Lines: 93 There has been a lot of discussion about Tyre.  In sum, Ezekiel prophesied that the place would be mashed and never rebuilt; as there are a lot of people living there, it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct. This doesn't bother me at all, because I understand the language Ezekiel used differently than do so-called Biblical literalists.  For example, it sometimes happens that someone says ""My grandson is the cutest baby!"" and then turns around and sees the granddaughter and says ""Oh!  Isn't she the cutest thing!?"" This person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the world according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for first.  Rather, he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very object-oriented.  Because this example is one that is common to many people, nobody misunderstands the intent of the statements; the Bible, however, is often at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly literally true.  For those people, the existence of Tyre is a problem; for me, it is not. Turning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel, we read this from John E King: > The prophesy clearly implies that people would still be living in the > area[.] No, it implies nothing of the kind.  If you had nothing but the prophecy from Ezekiel, and you were told you interpret it literally, you would never say ""Oh, he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff like that.""  You would read ""I will make you a bare rock"" and ""You will never be rebuilt"", and you'd conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock.  The only way to get from `fishing nets' to `houses and buildings and a medium-large population' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there. In other words, your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the prophecy at the time it was written.  There is no way that, given a literal reading, they could read this passage and conclude ""medium-size city"". You seem to feel that ""Never be rebuilt"" means ""be rebuilt"" -- maybe so, but it is hardly a `clear implication'. Mr King also writes: > So far I've seen stated figurers ranging from 15,000 to 22,000. > Let's assume the latter one is correct.  By modern standards > we are talking about a one-horse town. Well, no.  That's only a bit less than the population of Annapolis, where I'm from.  You know, the Naval Acadamy, the state capital, George Washington resigned his commission in the statehouse?  Annapolis may not be New York, but it's at least a two-horse town. But supposing 22,000 people is a ""small town"" -- it's still 22,000 people MORE than Ezekiel predicted. And you've said nothing about the other problem.  In chapter 26, Ezekiel predicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their valuables.  However, Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre, and in chapter 29 Ezekiel even quotes God as saying ""he and his army got no reward from the campaign he led against Tyre."" Let's ignore Alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26. Ezekiel says N. would destroy Tyre, and N. did NOT destroy Tyre.  Ezekiel says that N. would plunder their valuables, but N. did NOT plunder their valuables. Regardless of what you think about Tyre _now_, the fact is that N. died before the place was destroyed.  Ezekiel said N. was going to do it, and N. did not.  * This post is, of course, pointless.  Inerrantists have an amazing ability to rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say. For example, I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26 by pulling some ""clear implications"" out of hat. When Ezekiel said that N. would ""demolish your towers"", that clearly implied that the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers used to be.  And when Ezekiel said that N. would ""demolish your fine houses and throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea"", that clearly implied that N. would never set foot on the island.  And when Ezekiel wrote that N. would ""build a ramp up to your walls"", that clearly implies that N. would spend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the walls. See?  A few ""clear implications"" that are totally contrary to the text, and you can reconcile anything you want. Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu ""[Do] You know why I'm the enabler?

The point is that when we recognize these ""instantiations"" of mathematical systems, we do so because we VALUE being able to describe and perhaps even to control these instantiations. There is always a driving purpose behind thought -- a motive, if you will. Sometimes that motive is relatively ""pure"", e.g. pursuit of knowledge, othertimes it's ""impure"", e.g. pursuit of money, or of physical pleasure. But it's always there. And even when it is a ""pure"" pursuit of knowledge, presumably one pursues knowledge in order to personally grow, develop, advance to a higher plane of being. So there is still an element of acquisition, of reaching, of grasping, even in the approach of the ""detached, objective"" scientist. >>Now if we're valuing procedures subjectively, and science is a procedure, >>science cannot be valued non-subjectively.

No, I think you are the one who is rather confused. There are two senses in which we can say that the phenomenon of ""the working of the DES chip"" is value-based: 	1) Because there is bound to be some reason why we built the DES 	   chip and started it running in the first place 		and 	2) Because the very notion/definition/concept of ""works"" has value 	   associated with it The first is a CAUSAL linkage -- we want it to work, therefore we CAUSE it to work. That is rather a mundane interpretation. The second, however, is a more subtle and deeper PHENOMENOLOGICAL linkage -- that the attribute ""works"" is itself, as everything else, presented to the human consciousness as a _valued_ fact, not just a fact-in-itself. You are perhaps justified in shooting down the causal linkage, but you have not begun to address the phenomenological linkage. >Suns in unpopulated solar systems shine without being blessed by your >values.

The universe does not DEPEND on human values, no, but our experience and understanding and concepts of the universe _are_ laced with human values.

Mitra is Sanskrit for Friend, as such He started out as an avatar of Lord Visnu  mentioned first in the Vedas. Later he seems to have risen to chief prominence  worshipped by the Persians. Associated with the Sun but NOT the Sun, he is  the lord of contract honor and obedience, therefore naturally worshipped by  soldiers. He was ordered by the Sun to slay the bull of heaven and He reluct-  antly agreed because of His obligation...the blood of that bull spilled and  grew all earth life...then Mitra and the Sun sat down to eat. Worship of Lord Mitra ended in Persia with the ascension of the Zoroastrians. Hundreds of years later He was rediscovered and thrown into the Official Roman  Pantheon (tm) for some semi-tricky reason, I forget why. But all references of  Him ended abruptly when He was stricken from same, so apparently His worship  was some sort of vehicle for advancement in the bureaucracy, like membership  in the Communist Party was in the Soviet Bloc. The sociology of religion in  ancient times is fascinating! Oh, His B-day was 25 Dec. Ahem. I am not sure if the mystery cult really lasted after His was booted from the  Roman Imperial God Roster or what. It contained mostly soldiers, with 7 levels  of initiation. They worshipped underground in caverns in pews. The bull horns  in those temples were for scaring away or impaling evil spirits, I'm not sure  that they had Mithraic significance or not. I don't know that the ritual meal was of a cannibalistic nature as is the  Christian masses. But eating deities goes way back to Old Kingdom Egypt. Someone mentioned bullfighting. Did Mithraists sacrifice bulls? I forget. More  likely, for a religious source, might be the shower of bull's blood enjoyed  by the worshippers of Cybele on the Day of Blood? Cybele worship extended all  throughout even up to France bigtime. ------- CHARLES HOPE   A54SI@CUNYVM   A54SI@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU GOVERNMENT BY REPORTERS...MEDIA-OCRACY.	other

I have to agree Matthew with this; I have certainly encountered a lot of anti-Catholic-religion propaganda & emotion (& some bigotry) from members of certain religious groups here.  They also practice their missionary work with zeal among Catholics in the United States, but to someone who is or was raised Catholic such rhetoric is pretty off-putting.  It may work better in an environment where there's a lot of popular anti-clericalism. Follow-ups set elsewhere, this no longer seems very relevant to Celtic issues to me. --"	other

I would expect this kind of behavior from the Evangelical Born-Again Gospel-Thumping In-Your-Face We're- The-Only-True-Christian Protestants, but I have always thought that Catholics behaved better than this. Friend Dennis, I urge you to follow the example of your fellow Catholics, of who I count many dozens as my friends, and practice your faith through good example and decent living and respect for the common humanity of others. Please do not stoop to the level of the E B-A G-T I-Y-F W-T-O-T-C Protestants, who think that the best way to witness is to be strident, intrusive, loud, insulting and overbearingly self-righteous. The imagery in the Song of Solomon is a little bit dated (get it? Middle East - date palms - oh, never mind) but apparently acceptable, on a steaminess level, to be accepted as part of the canon. From this fact I derive that erotica itself is not incompatible with Catholic doctrine. Is there such a thing as Catholic erotica? Not necessarily a love story between people of that faith, but a love story that is not exploitative, does not seek redemption through penis size, pays proper respect to the dignity of each partner, and is still erotic enough to have a place on a.s.s. I would submit that the _Darknites_ series of stories qualify, also most of the _Journal Entries_, and _Rings I and II_. I would guess that your aim is to cut down on the pornography and increase the erotica. I actually agree with you that nearly all of the ""I've got an enormous dick, and I shot my wad all over her face"" stories are crap. I count them as noise, which makes my take on the signal-to-noise ration much lower than many other people's. Since you are one of the few posters here who can actually write decent prose, could you write a few stories for us instead of overwhelming us with commentary? > Anyway, this is a big subject.

Traditional wisdom says you are almost certainly better off selling it yourself if you don't mind that extra hassle.  Having a trade-in on a purchase just makes getting the best price from a dealership more confusing. >i know that the ""blue book"" value for the car is $2825. I assume this is _retail_ bluebook.  There are two bluebook prices, one for retail and one for wholesale.  You really want the retail price if you can get it.  The blue books also have adjustments you can make for low mileage and extras on your particular car.  You should look all this stuff up yourself. Also keep in mind that the blue book prices are averages over the country that may not apply in your area.  For example, blue book prices are low for California.  A better way of finding out how much your car might be worth is to call around and see what it's selling for (if any used lots have one) or looking in local papers for similar cars and checking out the prices.  It might be more time efficient to take a small loss (rather than hold out for 6 months for the best price). >an acquaintence >has offered to give me blue book value for the car. I don't know what you mean by ""an acquaintance"" but I would make darn sure that I was paid, that is, cashier's check in full before delivery.  There's a real temptation when selling to a pseudo-friend to be more accomodating than you should.  Make sure you get the money and if they hedge about paying in full at the start (with a cashier's check or cash) then I would go elsewhere.  Rememeber that you can probably sell your car to a used car lot or wholesaler and get wholesale bluebook.  That's probably a safer approach than selling to a private party. -- -- Alan                        # Mountain Dew and doughnuts...    ..!ames!elroy!alan          # because breakfast is the most important meal    alan@elroy.jpl.nasa.gov     # of the day."	rec.autos

I asked for the same coverage and same deductibles. Most of the companies charge you according to your zip code. Others charge according to your city. Anyhow, I gave the same zip code and city to all three places. Here's what I found (for a '93 Integra GS): AAA: ~$2000/yr. State Farm: 2614.92/yr. Allstate: 1220/yr. AAA is non-profit, so they said I could also expect to receive about $200-300 back at the end of the year. Still, There is a huge gap between all of these companies. State Farm wants MORE than TWICE as much as Allstate. I think I should be suspicious, but I've never heard anybody else complain. Any comments? Thanks, Gregg L. Kasten gregg@cs.stanford.edu	rec.autos

You can rev that car all day, everyday, and you'll never blow a hose, or crack the block, or anything else. (I speak from expierence!) I'm not saying the Quad 4 is a bad engine, but don't highlight reliability when you comparing it to a Acura Engine.  AND while the Integra costs alot more, it is a better investment since it will hold its value considerably much better.  And does a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time. NOTE: this isn't a flame on the GTZ, or other GM Quad 4 products.  THe Berreta is a nice car, and puts out respectable performance and a very reasonable price not to mention, it has an Airbag.  But to start quoting figures from one source, isn't too reliable.  Read other sources, and drive both cars.

The colored waxes just color in the scratches so they're not so apparent.  The better approach is to buff minor scratches completely off with a cleaner/mild abrasive.

This seems to be a popular scam with dealers.  Last month my brother bought a new Audi 90 series quatro from a local dealer.  They came back with the final price, tax and all, and he added it up for himself.  There happened to be an extra $300 tagged on under the tax part. He pointed out their error and asked them to re-think their addition.  They came back with the right price the next time.	rec.autos

And once you've been dropped by any insruance company you become labled a high risk, and end up forking out 3 or 4 times what you should be for insurance. My suggestion, stay where you are, or shop around but STAY AWAY from Geico! Jeff	rec.autos

Unfortunately, a Taurus is not exactly a -> muscle car, so I'm looking for ways to increase the performance. There is a company in Florida that sells computer chips that supposedly get a few HP and Torque out of the 3.0. Don't have the address, but saw the ad in Hot Rod and some other car magazines. Also, you could open up the exhaust (get an exhaust with a larger i.d.) Hope this helps. If you find anything else, let me know. I've got a 1990 Taurus L.

Hear, hear!  Thanks, Robbie. You also don't read that much about violence *against* teenagers, such as George Bush burying alive tens of thousands of unarmed Iraqi 17-year-olds, who were trying to surrender, with bulldozers. On the other hand, I think it *is* true, without singling out teenagers for blame, that violence is more socially acceptable than it used to be.

I was schocked to hear that ABC's telecast was the fifth most watched sporting event over the weekend. National rating came out to a very respectable 3.3. Top-29 Nielsen markets were at 2.9. In Boston,the game scored lower at 2.4 but it had some competion from local sports teams. Quite frankly, I expected ABC's ratings to be under 2.0. But I'm happy to be proven wrong! Well,well...Sometimes it pays off clicking away on your cable-tv remote control.:-) And if you happen to be a hockey fan,you could just stumble upon a playoff hockey game... ESPN picked up Detroit-Toronto game on Monday night because the only night game in MLB was being rained out in Chicago. You have to give ESPN credit for switching to Detroit's FOX-50 coverage and having Bill Clement at a Pittsburgh's TV station(WATE?) for intermission analysis. Maybe,ESPN people were giddy over perliminary over-night ABC ratings for Sunday's telecast and thought it was a good idea to feature the Norris division showdown rather than a monster truck competion.

So there's a kind of nostagia for the old days, before expansion, the Soviet series, Gretzky and even Bobby Orr, when guys weren't afraid to take a hit, nobody floated and defensemen played defence. Who cares that that probably never really existed, the myth is still around in Canada and all the European in fluence on the game has diminished it in some people's eyes. Personally, I'd like to add before I get flamed, I love the fast-paced ""European"" game and think Don Cherry is a bit of an idiot. I have to say that I missed him when I was living in the States, though. He is entertaining, even if you end up throwing your popcorn at the screen when he's on. -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I stand by all the misstatements that I've made. 		-- Vice President Dan Quayle to Sam Donaldson, 8/17/89 Me Too -- Nick Duncan <duncan@mprgate.mpr.ca>"	other

I think that if each series goes its max I could be watching hockey playoffs for 40-some odd consecutive nights (I haven't counted so that's a pure guess). I have two tv's in my house, and I set them up side-by-side to watch MON-QUE and keep an eye on BOS-BUFF at the same time.  I did the same for the two afternoon games. Btw, those ABC commentaters were great!  I was quite impressed; they seemed to know that their audience wasn't likely to be well-schooled in hockey lore and they did an excellent job.

Their cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of 17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to the playoff-bound Blues. The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3. With the North Stars' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit playing. They held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer. Tampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating supervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired. ``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,"" Blues coach Bob Berry said. If the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues' disappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered Berry's anger. ``It wasn't pretty at the end,"" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as good as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but it did."" Still, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end. Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks in a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at Chicago Stadium. The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points, their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay, which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its first season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points. The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous Blues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment. ``It's a shame we let down,"" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score two goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others. ``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have ended 6-2 and everyone would be happy."" Instead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs. ``We won, and that's all that matters,"" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3 for the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play."" Some players didn't have a problem. ``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,"" said Rich Sutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You can't allow five goals like we did, that's not right. ``It was disappointing to see what was going on."" Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow, he missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss. ``I didn't know it was final,"" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the bench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs, and that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the end."" The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score showed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third period. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time. ``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,"" Berry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took."" If Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might bother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit. Until the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd going at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then, Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period. With the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period. Then, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone. Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the rebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend. Last year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form of cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23. ``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,"" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and I know he was watching. I know he's happy."" Miller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo at 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds later, making it 5-1. Less than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland scored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass from Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period. Then, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third period, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third period. The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the winner. ``We were in there,"" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.""   %*%*%*%**%*%%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*   *   __  ______________         ____________________________________    %   %   \ \_)____________/         A L L E Z   L E S   B L U E S  ! ! !    *   *    \    __________/          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    %   %     \    ________/                                                   *   *      \   _______/                  Joe Ashkar                        %   %       \  \                         Contact for the Blues             *   *        \  \  SAINT LOUIS           jca2@cec1.wustl.edu               %   %        (___)             BLUES                                       *   *%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%"	other

I saw him play in the Swedish championship  game for junior players this year, and he played very well, a physical game,  but not the kind of rough stuff that Ulfie does (I suspect you would like to  have a Ulf type-of-player on the B's team too? :)  As for Mariusz Czerkawski, he has had a *great* season for Hammarby in  division 1. He scored -if I remember correctly- 93 points this season,  and then we have to keep in mind that a 50+ point season in Sweden is  considered *very good* due to the limited number of games. Mariusz is  Djurgarden property (he was just on loan to Hammarby), so he will play  in Elitserien next season, unless the B's can get him of course.  I would say that Mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to  watch in Swedish hockey this season.

While I agree that Lemieux deserves the Hart, it is far from a ""no-brainer"". The Hart trophy goes to the player most valuable to his team, not to the best player in the league. So your above arguement is really worthless. The Pens without Mario are still a damn good hockey team. The Leafs without Gilmour would have been fighting Tampa Bay for the 3rd pick. Like I said, Mario deserves it, IMHO. But it is a very close race and a Gilmour victory would not surprise me.

I have to wonder about the intelligence of signing a 33-year old who is obviously on the downside of his career to a 4-year $2 million contract. Risebrough matched the offer on King's request and Makarov has spent the last quarter of the season in the press box because his work ethic just plain stinks. Not to mention that he's lost a step and can no longer get himself into position to make the nifty passes. I think Makarov will be available for free this offseason to anybody who agrees to pay his contract. He's ineffective in Calgary, but he might be able to help a team like San Jose, with their shortage of talent. If there's no takers, and Makarov doesn't show improvement in training camp, I think the Flames will just bite the bullet and buy out Makarov's contract and release him. With his current attitude, he is a detriment to the team. 								Alan"	other

When Quinn took over Vancouver- several years ago, NOT LAST YEAR, they regularily missed the playoffs.  I can't recall if they missed the playoffs the year before his hiring but they probably did.  Quinn has improved the team from non-playoff calibre to a serious contender. When Murray took over in Detroit, the were about a .500 team that was a contender to win the Norris division and possibly even a Stanley Cup contender. So Quinn has improved his team more than Murray has since taking over as a GM. Quinn is one example of a better GM than Murray. Gregmeister	other

These players all are pretty good players.  They are the depth that the dynasties had to win Stanley Cups.  They tend to be the very good second line guys- who would be first liners on most weaker clubs in the NHL. They were all important to their clubs.  Probably, several of these Stanley Cup winning teams would not have won the cups they did if it were not for the depth provided by these players. They compare to Rick Tocchet and Ron Francis of the Penguins.  Very good players who can lead lesser teams (Francis-Hartford, Tocchet-Philly) who provide the depth to the team that is currently best in the NHL. As a defensive forward, there have been none better than Bob Gainey.  That doesn't mean he was the best player (or even the best forward) the Canadians had at that time, but he was excellent at what he did.  Gainey could dominate games with his defence.  He didn't need to get goals to dominate. He shut down the opposition and was thus valuable.  There has never been anyone any better at doing this.  Not ever. Gregmeister	other

No, and in fact, that was Ferreira's original strategy, which the troika proceeded to simply continue to implement. There wasn't exactly a radical shift in policy when he was ousted (something people seem to forget). The only real question is whether they did it as well as Ferreira could have if he stayed, or whether the basic strategy was flawed (since Ferreira has been quoated as saying he's going to do something different in Anaheim with the Ducks, my guess is that it wasn't as good in practice as it was on paper, and he's tweaking it a bit second time around). One also has to wonder whether the strategy would have been a lot better if we hadn't had those injuries, and whether we're complaining about the weather because an earthquake collapsed the root cellar. >Of course, Ferreira had also traded a number of veterans with marginal >contributions before he was fired, so it's not clear that this would have >been different.  Besides, they *were* marginal contributors. Let's also NOT FORGET that Ferreira came *THIS* close to trading Kelly Kisio, which, if the rumors I've heard are true, was over the strong objections of other aspects of Shark management and probably had a lot to do with both his ouster and the three-headed, consensus oriented GM.

A good GM (like Murray) can I think Murray has done a great job.  He's picked up Ciccarelli, Sheppard, Ysebaert, Howe, Coffey, and Riendeau (plus some depth players) without giving up anything the Wings needed or any of his top prospects. All of this in three years.  Has anyone done better? The year before he took over, the Wings didn't even make the playoffs. There was about a year and a half during Demers' stint that the Wings did OK, but that was due to Demers' motavational skills and clutch and grab style.  They didn't have much talent. Gerald, Murray wasn't responsible for Primeau (although I'm not ready to admit that's a horrible pick).  They hired him after the draft (which has never made sense to me).  His first pick was Lapointe. Ron ********** ""And one of my major goals is to leave the next president a new set of things to worry about.

One time a friend of mine at Sun sent me an e-mail.  He composed it using the Sun OpenWindows 3 ""mailtool"" which handles (non-MIME) ""attachments"" and the like. Since I don't use ""mailtool"", I had to manually save it, cut & paste, and then ""uudecode"" the actual attachment.  What I got - after a not-inconsiderable amount of time spent doing this - was an audio file.  The original message was over 32Kb of mail headers and uuencoded data; the resulting audio message was a single sentence that I transcribed as a 135 character message. If he had sent me the sentence in plain text, the e-mail would have been around 250 bytes, and it would have taken me about 3 seconds to process it at most.  Instead, it was 32k and it took at least a minute.  A complete waste of (my) time and bandwidth, as far as I'm concerned.  Sending plain text is still the most efficient method of transmission, given the same transport mechanism. I shudder to think what would happen if everyone started posting their Usenet articles as audio files instead of plain text!  Meltdown of the Net predicted! Film at Eleven! Back to Mono!

I'm afraid this doesn't work either. We can pick up laptop screens without any problem. Most of the so-called `low radiation' monitors are also useless. The description turns out to a marketing assertion rather than an engineering one. We thought there might be a market for a monitor which was not as hugely expensive as the military Tempest kit, but which was well enough shielded to stop eavesdropping using available receivers. We built a prototype, it works, and it's still sitting on my lab bench. Commercial interest was exactly zero. In the absence of open standards, a monitor which really is `low radiation' (and costs 500 dollars more) can't compete against a monitor which just claims to be `low radiation' (and whose only extra cost of production is the pretty blue sticker on the box).

I think the AD21020 should have enough juice for this (50MIPS). As part of the project I'm working on now, we're trying to get CELP up and running in realtime full duplex mode...

Just for the hell of it, let's destroy this remark. Let us imagine that the executive branch actually could extract keys from the escrow houses without anyone knowing, or telling. Now what?

Goodness, wait 'til the washington post gets hold of this) and decrypt the noise. 	3) More likely, stare at the key, and say 'Oh, hell it's not worth all this bloody hassle' 	Truth is, even granted *lots* of covert power on the part of the Executive Branch, this system is *more* difficult to tap with than POTS gear.

Mr. Read         said you can't cook a frog by boiling a pot of water and         then throwing the frog in.  His reflexes are so quick that         as soon as his feet touch the water, he will leap away.         You must put the frog in a pot of cold water and heat it         up bit by bit.  By the time the frog realizes he's being         cooked, it is too late.  It is the same with Americans.         If anyone tried to take our freedoms all at once, we         would naturally rebel and suppress the tyrant.  But as         with successful frog cooking, our liberties can be taken         a little bit at a time. The last line of the article says, ""It's not too late for us, but the water is getting pretty warm.""  I'd have toagree that it's warm and the Clipper is keeping the temperature on an upward course.

Here is some information ""from the horse's mouth"". (Regarding the sufficient overwriting of media (""clearing"") meant to be *retained* within the controlled environment, or declassifying the material to be reused *outside* the controlled environment,) From National Telecommunications and Information Systems Security (NTISS) ""Advisory Memorandum on Office Automation Security Guidelines""  (NTISSAM COMPUSEC/1/87): ------ ""7.6.2.1 Clearing of Magnetic Media Certain types of removable media (e.g., magnetic tape, floppy disk, cassettes, and magnetic cards) may be cleared by overwriting the entire media one time with any one character.  Floppy disks may be cleared by applying a vendor's formatting program that overwrites each location with a given character. Fixed media (e.g., Winchester disks) should be cleared by overwriting at least one time with any one character.  One way to do this is by applying a vendor-supplied formatting program that overwrites each location on the disk with a given character, if it can be shown that this program actually works as advertised.  The user should beware: some programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not actually do this. Cleared media may be resides within the controlled facility or released for destruction; however, they should be marked and controlled at the level of the most restrictive sensitivity of information ever recorded. 7.6.2.2 Declassification of Magnetic Media Certain types of removable media can be declassified using a degaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media of that type.  (A list of approved devices is maintained by the NSA.) If a fixed medium (for example, a hard, or Winchester, disk) is operative, an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to employ an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all addressable locations at least three times by writing any character, then its complement (e.g., binary ones and binary zeros) alternatively. When fixed  media become inoperative, it is impossible to declassify the media by the overwrite method.  In this case, there are two alternate procedures that may be used: (1) disassemble the disk pack, and degauss each platter with the appropriate approved degaussing equipment; and (2) courier the inoperative media to the vendor's facility, have the magnetic media (e.g., disk platter) removed in sight of the courier and returned to the courier for destruction at the secure site.  The vendor can then install new platters and repair any other problems with the disk unit. 7.6.3 Destruction of Magnetic Media"" [see DoD Computer Security Center, ""Department of Defense Magnetic Remanence Security Guideline"", CSC-STD-003-85  FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY] ------ This and many other interesting documents (many that are more informative than probably intended) on computer security procedures can be obtained (free) from: Executive Secretary National Telecommunications and Informations   Systems Security Committee National Security Agency Fort George G.

Being a PhD-student at David Chaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research in the field of privacy-protecting cash systems. The report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z, contains 77 pages, and can be retrieved from ftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180) from the directory pub/CWIreports/AA. The postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters. ==================================================================== ABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cash system based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which little use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the first to be based entirely on discrete logarithms.  Using the representation problem as a basic concept, some techniques are introduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier systems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in both computation and communication complexity than any such system proposed previously. Another important aspect of our system concerns its provability. Contrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be mathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if we make one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the ability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the Diffie-Hellman problem. Our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in previously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of these is that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be incorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has the important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the first place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender after the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under the most stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user, which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems. Another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have negligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by a simple mechanism from within the system, which is something that previous solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash system can be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, while retaining its computational efficiency. ==================================================================== Cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system! I made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as possible.  Nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail to me and I will try to reply as good as I can. Any comments are also welcome!

Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential analysis). Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel.  The purpose of this chip is twofold: 	1) Transmit Channel 	    The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with 	    a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number 	    unrecoverable with just the system key 	2) Recieve Channel 	    The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number 	    with a secondary keying variable (assuming the serial number 	    is necessary for local operation). This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  This gets more interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large, making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and a spoofed serial number.  Without knowing the system key, you could lie about the serial number, but risk detection of the lie. IF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the format of your own serial number. Makes you wonder whats being hidden here?   Seems  like the secrecy is to prevent you from lying about who you are."	other

No, but they could compell you to produce the key to a safe where, as it happens, evidence that will convict you is stored. The crypto-key disclosure issue hasn't come up yet, but current law suggests that it's a loser for the defendant--he'll be compelled to turn over the key. The test for compelled self-incrimination is whether the material to be disclosed *in itself* tends to inculpate the discloser. In the example I gave above, the safe key itself has no testimonial value--ergo, it can be disclosed under compulsion (e.g., subpoena duces tecum). Moreover, the government can always immunize the disclosure of a crypto key--compelling you to disclose the key at the price of not using the fact of your disclosure as evidence in the case against you. Of course, they can use whatever they discover as a result of this disclosure against you. --Mike -- Carl Kadie -- I do not represent any organization; this is just me.  = kadie@cs.uiuc.edu =	other

If it isn't at one of    the receiptants location, forget encryption at all.  You have blown any    security you thought you might have had. Most of the people using encrypted conference bridges these days are military (or equivalent, like CIA and other embassy personnel), so putting bridges on the recipient's location is normal - it's in a vault on a military base or Ft. Meade, and the secure phones are in sound-proof rooms with big locks on the doors because they're talking about Classified Stuff (or Golf with Other Generals.) That paradigm will change as we start using encrypted phones in our offices or homes to carry on normal conversations about dinner plans and stock purchases and meeting schedules and technical info and the good batch of illegal frop that we got last weekend from Bob; most people don't use sound-proof vaults, and may use bridges in their PBX or from the local phone company (3-way calls) or Long Distance or value-added phone company (e.g. Alliance conference bridges). If Clipjack is mainly used for the radio portion of cellular phones, the conferencing aspects don't change.  But there may be a market niche for trusted conference-bridge providers, though I suppose the inquisitors would try to get a blanket wiretap authorization for many bridges, just in case a Bad Guy might use the service. -- #				Pray for peace;      Bill # Bill Stewart 1-908-949-0705 wcs@anchor.att.com AT&T Bell Labs 4M312 Holmdel NJ #	              No, I'm *from* New Jersey, I only *work* in cyberspace.... # White House Commect Line 1-202-456-1111  fax 1-202-456-2461"	other

Then replace ""prince"" with ""government"" or ""president"", as appropriate, and read it again. [From Chapter XX of _The Prince_, by N. Macchiavelli, as translated by Daniel Donno.] 	In order to keep their lands secure, some princes have disarmed their subjects; others have prompted division within the cities they have subjugated.  Some have nurtured animosities against themselves; others have sought to win the approval of those they initially distrusted.  Some have erected fortresses; others have destroyed them.  Now, although it is impossible to set down definite judgements on all of these measures without considering the particular circumstances of the states where they may be employed, I shall nevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself will allow. 	To begin with, there has never been a case of a new prince disarming his subjects.  Indeed, whenever he found them disarmed, he proceeded to arm them.  For by arming your subjects, you make their arms your own.  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal, while those who are already loyal remain so, and from subjects they are transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all, nonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by extending privileges to those you arm.  Your different treatment of the two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you, while the former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties and dangers should receive advantages. 	When you disarm your subjects, however, you offend them, by showing that, either from cowardliness or from lack of faith, you distrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you. Moreover, since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed, you would have to resort to mercenaries, whose limitations have already been discussed. Even if such troops were good, however, they could never be good enough to defend you from powerful enemies, and doubtful subjects.  Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a newly acquired state has always taken measures to arm his subjects, and history is full of examples proving that this is so. 	But when a prince takes posession of a new state which he annexes as an addition to his original domain, then he must disarm all the subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire it; and these, as time and occasion permit, he must seek to render soft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of the entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to his original domain. 	... 	And since the subject demands it, I will not fail to remind any prince who has acquired a new state by the aid of its inhabitants that he soundly consider what induced them to assist him; if the reason is not natural affection for him, but rather dissatisfaction with the former government, he will find it extremely difficult to keep them friendly, for it will be impossible to please them.  If he will carefully think the matter through in the light of examples drawn from ancient and modern affairs, he will understand why it is much easier to win the favor of those who were happy with their former government, and hence were his enemies, than to keep the favor of those who, out of dissatisfaction with the former rule, helped him to replace it."	other

The implications of some details are fascinating. ------- Date: Sat, 17 Apr 93 23:05:23 PDT From: ""Martin Hellman"" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu> To: (a long list of recipients) Subject: Clipper Chip Most of you have seen the announcement in Friday's NY Times, etc. about NIST (National Institute of Standards & Technology) announcing the ""Clipper Chip"" crypto device. Several messges on the net have asked for more technical details, and some have been laboring under understandable misunderstandings given the lack of details in the news  articles. So here to help out is your friendly NSA link: me. I was somewhat surprised Friday to get a call from the Agency which supplied many of the missing details. I was told the info was public, so here it is (the cc of this to Dennis Branstad at NIST is mostly as a double check on my facts since I assume he is aware of all this; please let me know if I have anything wrong): The Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in Silicon. Each chip will have two secret, 80-bit keys. One will be the same for all chips (ie a system-wide key) and the other will be unit specific. I don't know what NIST and NSA will call them, but I will call them the system key SK and unit key UK in this message. The IC will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so that the system key can be kept secret. (Aside: It is clear that they also want to keep the algorithm secret and, in my opinion, it may be as much for that as this stated purpose.) The unit key will be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 and K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow authorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be decided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that they will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased. When a law enforcement agency gets a court order, they will present it to these two escrow authorities and receive K1 and K2, thereby allowing access to the unit key UK. In addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his or her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key plain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be encrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK, and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK producing      E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK} When a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law enforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information flowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that they may do this constantly on all links, with or without a court order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links over which a message will flow.] This gives the agency access to      E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number in the above message. They then check the serial number of the unit and see if it is on the ""watch list"" for which they have a court order. If so, they will decrypt E[K; UK] to obtain K, and then decrypt E[M; K] to obtain M. I am still in the process of assessing this scheme, so please do not take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed scheme. All I am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme more knowledgably. But I will say that the need for just one court order worries me. I would feel more comfortable (though not necessarily comfortable!) if two separate court orders were needed, one per escrow authority. While no explanation is needed, the following story adds some color: In researching some ideas that Silvio Micali and I have been kicking around, I spoke with Gerald Gunther, the constitutional law expert here at Stanford and he related the following story: When Edward Levi became Pres. Ford's attorney general (right after Watergate), he was visited by an FBI agent asking for ""the wiretap authorizations."" When Levy asked for the details so he could review the cases as required by law, the agent told him that his predecessors just turned over 40-50 blank, signed forms every time. Levi did not comply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear: No single person or authority should have the power to authorize wiretaps (or worse yet, divulging of personal keys). Sometimes he or she will be an Edward Levi and sometimes a John Mitchell. Martin Hellman ---- Date: Sun, 18 Apr 93 11:41:42 PDT From: ""Martin Hellman"" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu> To: smb@research.att.com Subject: Re: Clipper Chip It is fine to post my previous message to sci.crypt if you also post this message with it in which: 1. I ask recipients to be sparse in their requesting further info from me or asking for comments on specific questions. By this posting I apologize for any messages I am unable to respond to. (I already spend too much time answering too much e-mail and am particularly overloaded this week with other responsibilities.) 2. I note a probably correction sent to me by Dorothy Denning. She met with the person from NSA that I talked with by phone, so her understanding is likely to better than mine on this point: Where I said the transmitted info is  E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK} she says the message is not double encrypted. The system key (or family key as she was told it is called) only encrypts the serial number or the serial number and the encrypted unit key. This is not a major difference, but I thought it should be mentioned and thank her for bringing it to my attention. It makes more sense since it cuts down on encryption computation overhead."	other

There are other laws and directives which bear upon the subject.  For example, the National Computer Security Act of 1987 specifically directs NBS [sic] to work with NSA on developing security standards for civilian Federal computers.  (Pick up the bill from cpsr.org; it also includes a report describing it, and some of the legislative history, including concerns about NSA's involvement.)  Note also that NSA is specifically charged with running the National Computer Security Center,  -- to quote the aforementioned report -- ``NSA also will work with industries at the DOD Computer Security Center to develop security standards for private sector use.'' It may or may not be a good idea to have NSA tinkering with this, but I'm pretty sure it's legal.  (Btw -- when it comes to development of cryptosystems, there may be two choices.  Either NSA helped develop it, in which case maybe they can crack it, maybe not, but probably, no one else can; or NSA didn't help, in which case they probably can crack it, and maybe others as well...)	other

Here are the details of the car: 1958 Hardtop--Exterior condition:      Rocker panels rusted out at weld points, no rust at typical spots like      door hinge mounting points, back battery box, etc.  Missing front bumper,      front pan dented up, one weld popped in front.  This is for the most part      a solid, restorable automobile.      Interior Condition:      Missing original steering wheel, has one of the smaller aftermarket      wheels, seats need reupholstered, general fair condition.      Mechanical Condition:      Had been running, but now does not want to start...needs new rings (which      I have) also have extra parts such as complete long block, extra steering      shaft, etc. For a car that has not been touched since 1958, it is in solid shape.  It will obviously need some work, but will make a good project. PRICE:  Well, this is a tough one, I would like to get around 800.00, but will consider any serious offers by individuals willing to come and get it.

I no longer want my Borland C++ 3.1 w/Application Frameworks product. This version is about 6 months old. I have all of the manuals, disks (5.25""), etc. It is licensed to me but I will transfer the license to the purchaser under the accepted terms of the Borland license agreement. I also have a copy of the books: ""Developing Windows Applications with Borland C++ 3"", James McCord, Sams (39.95) ""Using Borland C++ 3 2nd ed"", Mark & Lee Atkinson"", Que  (29.95) I'd like to do is sell it all to the highest bidder under the conditions listed below. I'll ship C.O.D. to anywhere in the U.S. via the shipper of your choice (provided they are local to me), and I will pay the COD charges (you just pay for the shipping). The list price for the product is about $750. I have seen it advertised for as low as $500. I will accept the best offer over $375 (plus shipping as described above) which is 1/2 the list price, plus, I'm tossing in the 2 books listed above (which are a $70 value). I will hold the bidding open through the weekend and close it sometime in the evening of 4/26/93. Please reply via eMail. Only serious offers please apply. No, I will not consider anything for trade, nor any offers less then $375 as I consider it a fair price.

Or be a Buddhist? The Buddha's commandments are 500 yrs older than Christ's and in my opinion tougher to follow. Moreover the Buddha says that we are intrinsically good (as against Christ's ""we are all sinners"").  Only we allow ourselves to be distracted. By meditating we can awaken ourselves (etc etc). Also there is no concept of God in Buddhism. (In my opinion you can be an Atheist and a Buddhist). But to ""awaken"" yourself is no easy task. Can you stay away from eating meat? Can you sit still and think of nothing (meditate) for sometime everyday? Buddhists do (or are supposed to). Can you pray five times a day? Can you fast for a month every year (Ramzan). Are you willing to give 1/6 th of your income as tithe? Muslims do. In fact I think Jesus was an ordinary man (just as Buddha and Mohamed) probably with a philosopy ahead of the times (where he lived). Considering the fact that Christianity is a young religion (compared to Hindiusm, Judaism, Zorasterism, Buddihsm) it is also very probable that the Bible is merely a collection of borrowed ideas. (There was a good deal of trade between the eastern lands and the middle east at the time of Christ). And perhaps some more.

I guess I would react rather strongly to this line of thinking carried out!  When you think ""your army"" is stronger than ""mine"", you would ""righteously"" take my children and baptize them, doing what you know is really ""best"" for them.    You cannot possibly put this kind of action, nor the crusades into the context of the teachings of Jesus/God.

Though I don't >mean to imply that all atheists are angry or hostile, >it does seem to be one motivation for giving up >faith.  Thus, some atheism might result from >broken-ness. I'd like to field this one, if I may.  Although I am a believer in and follower of Christ, my experiences with religion haven't been all that positive.  In fact, there was one point in my life when, for about three days, I simply _couldn't_ believe in the existence of God.  Anyway, when I look back upon the troubles I've had, they seem to fall into two categories -- impulses to unbelief that resulted from logical contradictions, and impulses to unbelief that resulted from frustration with God. The first category doesn't occur to me much anymore, as I have worked through most of the arguments for the non-existence of God.  But way back when, these would cause me some problems, and I would have to struggle with my faith to continue to believe.  I can see where others less stubborn than I (and I do mean stubborn.  Stubborness has often been the only thing standing between me an atheism from time to time) would fail. The second category arises out of some long-term personal difficulties and the struggle to live my life as God would have me live it WITHOUT living my life as others would tell me how God would have me live it.  A good example of this is my struggle with the more radical Christians I meet.  I am not, nor have I ever been, ""on fire for Chirst,"" and I don't think I ever want to be. Nevertheless, I am not ""lukewarm"" about my faith, so I don't really fit in with the mainstream either.  Quite naturally, I feel a lot of anxiety about my dislocation within Christian society, and it can lead to a lot of internal tension, when I want to do what I _know_ is right, but when another part of me believes that what I want to do is wrong because all the other Christians think so to.  Quite naturally, this tension has a destructive effect on my relationship with God, and during all of this internal strife, there's atheism sitting there like the promised land -- no rules, no responsibilities, no need to live up to anyone's expectations but my own. Complete freedom.  Of course, it's all an illusion, but nevertheless, it's a very appealing illusion, especially when the so-called ""people of God"" are behaving like total twits.  I can easily understand why someone would go that route, and would be hostile to ever coming back. IMHO, many of the former-Christians-turned-atheists-who-are-now-actively- hostile-to-Christianity are so because their experience with Christ and God wasn't a very peaceful one, but one of mind-control and ""shut-up-and-do-what- you're-told-because-we-know-what's-best-for-you-because-it's-God's-will-and- you're-to-young-to-know-what-God's-will-is-yet"" courtesy of some of Christ's more overzealous followers. A final reason why people become atheists is because Christians do not have a very good reputation right now.  One of the things that attracted people to Christianity in the ancient days was the love that Christians obviously had for one another and the world around them.  Unlike the rest of the world, Christian communities actively cared for their poor, and the Christian rich did not trod on the backs of their poorer brothers, but bent down to help them.  Christians were known for living exemplary lives, even if they were thought to be traitors to the state because they wouldn't sacrifice to the emporer.  Nowadays, courtesy of the media and some Christian leaders who lost Christ on their way to power, people see Christians as sexually-repressed hippocritical busibodies who want to remake society into a facist version of their own moral view. There are a lot more reasons why people become atheists, but I don't have time to go into them right now. Tom Ault"	other

A very specific, somewhat miraculous example of the truth of God working to help His followers is soemthing that happened to me. For nearly 4 years after an accident I had severe complications from a triple fracture in my left leg and surgery--pins put in, then removed. The bone itself was perfectly healed. No infectoin that could be detected. Yet I was in constant pain and it my ankle and foot were always swollen and bluish. More complicatios developed in my other leg, none of which could be explained by the best specialists and most sophisticated tests in te northern Illinois region. We went everywhere--no one could explain it. Durin gthat summer (June 19, 1991 to be exact) I gave my life and heart to Christ and vowed to relinquish control over my life (which i never really had anyway) because of what he did for me on the cross and the fact that my whole life was screwed up by me trying to fix it. I was facing the possibility of a lifetime in a wheelchair (I was confined to one in order to save my legs from any further damage since the cause of my problems were unknown, had been in it for about 2 1/2 months before that day). 	I found it ore than coincidental that less than 2 weeks after I put my faith where my mouth was, one more in the long line of doctors and not even an orthopeodic specialist, diagnosed my problems with no difficulty, set me on the path to an effective cure, and I was walking and running again without the pain that had stopped me from that for 4 years. The diagnosis was something he felt the other doctors must have ""overlooked"" because it was perfectly obvious from my test results. 	Maybe this doesn't hit you as miraculous. But to me it really is. Imagine an active 17 year old being told she may not be able to walk mcuh longer...and is now a happy 18 year old who can dance and run knowing that the problem was there all along and was ""revealed"" just after she did what she knew was right.

I don't claim to be an expert on the branch Davidians, but I might know more than most. The Branch Davidian group (led by Koresh) is actually one of two off-shoots of a group known as the Shephard's Rod.  The Shephard's Rod (now defunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's. The Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the SDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they were the remnant spoken about in Revelation. About the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once in control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as Christ. Koresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over the youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians. They were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of weapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US government or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were putting themselves in a self defense position. In my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn' t have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco. If you want to know about The Shephard's Rod, you might want to visit the local SDA church and talk to some of the older people.  They could give you some insight into where Koresh got his theology.

I'm not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame (thanx in advance) I want to know why there are so many different versions of the bible? There is this version of the bible I have read about and on the front page it says: ""....contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies."" 					Thanx in advance... Shaz.... [I'm not sure quite what you mean by many different versions. The primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style of the translation.  It's pretty unusual to see significant differences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying text.  That's because before printing, manuscripts were copied by hand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts around that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the original, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are generally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are something like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved, but with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I don't think there's much uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians believe that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of translating is free of error.  But I also don't think there's enough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that it has much practical effect. Whether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot topic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it (though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details that don't affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there being multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in all the versions.  I'm surprised to find a reference to this on the title page though.  What version are you talking about?  I've been referring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get referenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been editions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes everything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into single narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor objects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible has long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making editions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editions that are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from a variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagine one of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all inaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, it's not any edition that's widely used.  The widely used ones leave the text as is. (Weeeeelllllll, almost as is.  It's been alleged that a few translations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize inconsistencies.  Because translation is not an exact science, there are always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best, I'm afraid.) --clh]"	other

There was an article in USA today a few months ago showing the results of a study that actually only about 1% were homosexual.  I saw another figure that listed 2% as the figure.  Of course, even if it were 99% that would have little bearing on whether or not it is a sinful behavior. How many people have commited other acts of fornication?  How many people have lied or sinned in other ways? >But in all fairness, the ""shameless"" nature of their acts is a >reflection of the general spiritual state of the people, and not a >specific feature of homosexuality. Why isn't it a specific feature of homosexuality?  Paul describes ""men with men working that which is unseemly"" to describe the acts. Sure, there spirtual nature was depraved also, and like the other sins, the idolatry, the other sexual immoraity, and the other sins sprang from their depraved spiritual state which was a result of man's not glorifying God as God and being thankful.  Still, their acts were shameless. >homosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases.  On the >other hand, none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the >subject.  Rom 1 is really about idolatry.  It refers to homosexuality >in passing. Is everything sinful specifically elaborated on in the New Testament? Scripture does not condemn being a drug dealer.  Being ruled by the Spirit rather than the letter not only frees from legalism, it also protects us from sins that are against the Spirit.  The word is a two edged sword that cuts both ways. I think we must be careful before we totally throw out Leviticus. If the Law is reflection of God's character and true holy nature, then those who say that God endorses homosexuality run into a problem. If homosexuality were ""natural"" (whatever that means) wholesome, endorsed by God, and those who oppose sexual behavior are narrow-minded biggots, as some would have us believe, why is there a condemnation of it in Leviticus.  This condemnation is in the midst of all the other sex sin condemnations, and there is nothing in the text to say that this law was limited to temple prostitution, and no good reason to believe that this was the case.  Furthermore, male homosexual sex was a death-penalty crime! Is every sin elaborated on in the New Testament?  Take a look at I Corinthians 5.  Paul said that one of the Corinthians had broken a law not even heard of among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.  There is a prohibition against having your father's wife in Leviticus.  No other new Testament verse clearly condemns it (besides this one.)  Notice that Paul did not say that the sin was in commiting adultery, etc.- he spoke against having one's father's wife. Notice also that this sexual condemnation in Leviticus is not mentioned in the specific context of paganism either.  And there was no pagan coustom mentioned in I corinthians either.  As a matter of fact taking one's father's wife wasn't even done among the Gentiles.  It was just a plain blantant sin, whether worshipping idols was involved or not. >One commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds >of questions we are trying to deal with.  He encountered homosexuality >only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was >wrong.  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act >""straight"" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying >to define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian >ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the >relationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Paul's >judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make >judgements on these questions. One of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument is because Paul probably did face this and other problems.  Sin can be tough to over come, especially without supernatural power.  Is homosexual sin any more difficult to overcome that heterosexual sin, like lusting after a married woman, or sleeping around with people of the opposite sex?  I doubt it, and even if it is, that is no excuse. God is greater than all of it. Another reason we reject it is because it ignores the supernatural power of God to intervene in this kind of situation.  How many people have been set free from sin by the power of God?  Sure there may be any groups that have tried to change homosexuals and failed. That is a reflection on the people involved in the program, and not God's willingness and ability to change a sinner.  Any program that uses formulas may fail.  What people need is the power of God to change them, whether they are involved in homosexual sin, or any other sin. >I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is >not entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.  Paul's >tendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating >holidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues >to look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and to >avoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging. >For example, while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat >meat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about >which they had personal qualms. I don't see how you come to that conclusion.  Paul's dealings with pastorial issues encouraged people to give up their liberties in order to spare others- not to allow people to continue in sin because it was just too difficult.  Take the example of eating meat offered to idols. Paul felt that there was nothing wrong, in an abstract sense, with eating the meat.  Yet he advised believers to sacrifice their liberty to eat meat in order to spare others. But Paul never allowed people to sin because living holy was just to tough.  Paul wrote to ""make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof.""  (Romans 13:14)  Then he goes in to a discourse on how we should sacrifice our own liberty in order to spare the consciences of others. Suppose it were not a sin for people to practice homosexual acts. Since others consider it to be a sin, then using Paul's approach on pastorial issues, those who would otherwise be homosexuals should sacrifice their liberty and be celbate or monogamously married to a member of the opposite sex.  Paul never offers a lesser sin (homosexual ""marriage"") to prevent people from engaging in what may be considered a more damaging sin. >For another example, Paul obviously >would have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances) >remain unmarried.  Yet if they were unable to do so, he certainly >would rather see them married than in a state where they might be >tempted to fornication. Yet marriage itself is not a sin.  marriage is holy in all- and something that God ordains, and Paul recognizes this. > Note that in the >creation story work enters human life as a result of sin.  This >doesn't mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved. Actually, Adam was put in the garden to tend to it before he fell. After he fell he would have to toil over the ground. >The dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often >fails, and when it does, you end up with damage ranging from >psychological damage to suicide, as well as broken marriages when >attempts at living as a heterosexual fail. That is why we are dependent totally on God- what a vunerable and glorious position to be it.  We all must be transformed by the renewing of our minds- and that is the only way homosexuals can walk in freedom, just like anyone else. >but I can well imagine Paul >preferring to see people in long-term, committed Christian >relationships than promiscuity.  As with work -- which Genesis >suggests wasn't part of God's original ideal either -- I think such >relationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God's love >with each other. I'm sure you can see how people with the opposing view see this conclusion.  It's like saying, ""How should I kill myself, with gun or aresenic?  What about the person who just is overcome with a desire to sleep with goats?  Would it be better for him to sleep with one goat, or all of them?  What about the person who wants to sleep with his aunts? Would it be better for him to sleep with one aunt or all of them? In all these cases, the more people or animals one sleeps with, the higher the chance that they will get a disease.  But this only deals with physical aspects of the question.  Whichever sin is commited, it all leads to spiritual death. >Cent. actions are the same.  When Christian homosexuals say that their >relationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul >would have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind of >argument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors. The issue that is most often addressed in Scripture seems to be the actual act.  Second, isn't it historical snobbery to say that only homosexuals of this century are capable of having ""loving relationships?""  There are ancient writings glorifying homosexual ""love."" (btw, I am one who believes in refraining from making oathes.  Also, where do you get that tax collectors are sinners.  That's certainly not explicit.  Jesus didn't tell Zachias to quit his job.) Link Hudson. [I'm reluctant to comment in this in detail.  Our basic concepts of the intention of Jesus and Paul are greatly different.  As I indicated in the article, whatever the ambiguities of various words (and I still think they are significant), it does seem clear that Paul considered the homosexuality he saw around him wrong.  What you do with this fact depends upon your basic approach to the Bible.  I'm afraid that communication between legalist and anti-legalist Christians is even harder than between Protestants and Catholics in the 16th Cent.  Since you disagree with my starting point, obviously you're going to disagree with all of the intermediate discussion and conclusions. Sometimes discussion is still useful.  I've seen some very interesting work on Paul done by Jews.  Obviously they don't agree with him, but they sometimes have helpful insight into what he meant.  But I don't see much sign for hope here.  In talk.religion.misc there's an axiom that by the time Hitler's name is invoked, all hope for sensible discussion is gone.  On this subject, when sleeping with goats is invoked, I don't think there's enough basis for understanding to be worth pursuing.  --clh]"	other

Analogies can only push an argument so far (on both sides).  Both Melinda's and yours assume the premises used to set up your respective analogies are true and thus the correct conclusion will arise. The important point to note is the different directions both sides come from. Christians believe they know the TRUTH and thus believe they have the right (and duty) to tell the TRUTH to all. Christians can get offended if others do not believe (what is self-evidently to them) the TRUTH. Non-christians do not believe this is the TRUTH and get offended at them because they (christians) claim to know the TRUTH. (BTW this argument goes for anyone, I am not just bagging christians) Neither side can be really reconciled unless one of the parties changes their mind.  As Melinda pointed out, there is no point in arguing along these lines because both approach from a different premise.  A more useful line of discussion is WHY people believe in particular faiths. Personally, I don't mind what anyone believes as long as they allow me mine and we can all live peacefully. > Steve Hayes, Department of Missiology & Editorial Department -- Don Lowe, Department of Physics, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 3168.	other

However, as only some are saved - and those who are saved are saved by the grace of God, ""not by works, lest any man should boast"" - the others are damned because of their obstinacy in refusing to heed the call of God.  They are damned by their own free will and chosing, a choice forseen by God in His causing them to be not predestined, but reprobated instead. >so God uses grace like margarine: he only spreads it where it's needed >and not where it isn't?  and so there are the saved and the not-saved, >and nothing in between.  hmmmm. Certainly God does not distribute grace evenly.  If He did, no one could have their heart hardened (or rather, harden their heart, thus causing God to withdraw His grace).  But, you are correct - the world is divided into those who God knows to be saved, and those God knows to be on the road to perdition.  THe key is that God knows it and we do not.  Thus, no one can boast in complete assurance that they are one of the elect and predestined.  But no one who is a Christian in good standin should doubt their salvation either (that shows a lack of trust in God). >be punished after we die.  you're saying what we get after we die has >a direct bearing on how we live now?  strange.... You must admit it is possible.  Anyway, why would you want something in the hear and know, when you can recieve 100 fold in heaven?  Better to lay up your treasure in heaven is what Jesus said. This is not to condemn the rich, but simply to point out that those who are rich are frequently very evil or immoral, so God must give them their blessing know, as they have chosen.  Remeber, Jesus promised tribulation in this world, and hatred of others because we are Christians.  He did not promise heaven on earth.  He promised heaven. >so sin is either punished now or later -- and not both?  what if it's > sort of half-punished?  are there any grey areas in this doctrine? Not really.  Unless you do penance here on earth, you will have to do it in Purgatory, as Paul pointed out (1 Corinthians 3.15).  Those with poorer works, though still done with good intentions, will only be saved through fire (the damned will of course go into fire immeadiately, for whatever good they did was not for God but for self (dead works)).  Of course, the Church gives indulgences, has Confession, and Annointing of the Sick to remove sin and the the vestiges of sin, so there is really little excuse for ending up in Purgatory - it is a last hope for the somewhat lazy and careless as I said above in referring to Paul. And no comments were taken as flames.  You are one of the more polite people I have talked to over the net. Andy Byler ps.

Lines: 154 Approved: christian@aramis.rutgers.edu Heres a nice story to help explain the virtues of purity, innocence and modesty, and their importance.     The Most Beautiful Virtues     This story is an excerpt taken from The  Basket  of  Flowers   by     Johann Christoph von Schmid     In a certain little market town, over a hundred years ago,	there     lived  an  upright	and  intelligent man named Jacob Rede. He was     married to a most virtuous young woman and they lived happily  in     a  humble  home which was in the midst of a large, beautiful val-     ley. After living many, happy years together, Jacob's wife	died,     leaving  him alone with only one friend...his daughter Mary. Even     as a child Mary was uncommonly pretty; but as she grew in  years,     her piety, her innocence, her modesty and her unfeigned kindne ss     towards all she came in contact with, gave to her beauty  a  rare     and  peculiar  charm. Her face was lighted up with a look of such     indescribable goodness, that  it  seemed  almost  as  though  one     looked upon an angel.     Mary's greatest delight was the beautiful garden and her  favour-     ite  flowers  were the violet, the lily and the rose. Jacob loved     to point to them as emblems of the virtues most becoming  to  her     gender.  When	she  once, early in March brought the first violet to     him and joyfully called upon him to admire it, he said:     Let the modest violet, my dear Mary, be to you an image of humil-     ity  and  of the benevolence that does good in secret. It clothes     itself in the tender colours of modesty; it prefers to  bloom  in     retired  grots; it fills the air with its fragrance while remain-     ing hidden beneath the leaves.  May you also, my  dear  Mary,  be     like  the  retiring violet, avoiding vain display, not seeking to     attract the public	eye,  but  preferring  ever  to  do  good  in     quietude and peace.     One morning when the roses and lilies were in full bloom and  the     garden appeared in its richest array, Jacob said to his daughter,     as he pointed out a beautiful lily,  which	was  beaming  in  the     morning sun:     Let the lily my dear child, be to you the emblem      of purity. Look how beautiful, how pure and fair it is! The whi-     test  linen is as nothing compared with the purity of its petals:     they are like the snow. Happy the maiden whose heart is  as  pure     and as free from stain. But the purest of all colours is also the     hardest 				   -5-     to preserve pure. Easily is the petal of the lily  soiled;	touch     it	but carelessly or roughly and a stain is left behind.  In the     same way, a word or a thought may stain the purity of  innocence!     Then pointing to a rose he said:      Let the rose my dear Mary, be to you an emblem of modesty.  More     beautiful  than the colour of the rose is the blush that rises to     the cheek of a modest girl. It is a sign that she is  still  pure     of	heart  and  innocent in thought. Happy is the maiden whom the     suggestion of a thought that is indelicate, will cause to  blush,     as	she  is thus put on her guard against the approach of danger.     The cheeks which readily blush will remain for a long  time  with     their  roseate  hue, while those which fail to blush at the least     indelicacy of thought will soon  become  pale  and	wan,  and  go     before their time to the grave.""     Among the many fruit trees that adorned the garden there was  one     that  was  prized above all the others. It was an apple tree, not     much larger than a rose bush, and stood by itself in  the  middle     of	the garden. Mary's father had planted it the day that she was     born and every year it bore a number of beautiful apples. Once it     blossomed  earlier	than  usual  and with unusual luxuriance. The     tree was one mass of blossom. Mary was so delighted with it  that     she went every morning as soon as she was dressed to look at      it. Once, when it was in full bloom, she called  to  her  father     and said:     Look father, how beautiful! Was there ever such a lovely mingling     of	red  and  white?  The whole tree looks like one huge bunch of     flowers!     The next morning she hastened into the garden to feast  her  eyes     once  more	upon the tree. But what was her grief to see that the     frost had nipped it and destroyed all its flowers. They were  all     become  brown  and	yellow	and  when  the	sun came forth in its     strength they withered and fell to the ground. Mary  wept  bitter     tears at the sight. Then said the father:     Thus, does sinful pleasure destroy the  bloom  of  youth.  Oh  my     child,  never  cease to remember how dreadful it is to be seduced     from the path of right! Behold in the example of the  apple  tree     an	image of what would happen if you were to wander from the way     - if the hopes your conduct  hitherto  has	raised	in  my	heart     should  vanish,  not  merely for a day or year, but for life. Ah,     then how much more bitter would be the tears which I  would  shed     over your lapse from virtue than those which now course down your     cheeks! Life would have no joys for me: with tears in my eyes  I     should 				   -6-     go down sorrowfully to my grave.     As he spoke, the tears stood in his eyes; Mary was deeply  moved,     and  the words he uttered made so profound an impression upon her     mind that she never forgot them.     Under the eyes of a father so  loving  and	wise,  and  amid  the     flowers  of  her  garden, Mary grew daily in stature and intelli-     gence - blooming as a rose, pure as a  lily  and  retiring	as  a     violet, and as full of promise as a tree laden with blossom.     Happy was the old man at all times to behold how plenteously  the     fruits  of	his  garden  rewarded his diligent toil; but with how     much more happiness and content did he mark the  gracious  effect     produced  upon  the heart and mind of his beloved daughter by his     pious teaching and example.     Jacob plucked several roses and lilies, tied them together	in  a     bunch and gave them to Mary with the words:     The lily and the rose, sister flowers as they are, belong the one     to	the  other;  both incomparable in their beauty, they are ren-     dered still more lovely by being together. In  the	same  way  my     dear  child  are innocence and modesty twin sisters of virtue and     cannot be separated     The greatest and most powerful guardian of purity is the  thought     of the presence of God -- Internet: simon@giaeb.cc.monash.edu.au Viva Cristo Rey !!

For    Isaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our message?'  Consequently, faith    comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word    of Christ.""    So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the    gospel.  Faith is a possible response to hearing God's word preached.  Kids    are not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to    respond to God's word.  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot    be raised in baptism to a new life. Catholics view the effects of Baptism slightly differently, and that's one primary reason why they baptize babies.  They believe that Baptism produces a change in the soul of the baby, quite independently of any volitional act on the part of the baby.  This change in the baby's soul gives the infant certain capabilities that he would not have without Baptism.  Since the infant does not have the use of his intellect and will yet, these new faculties are dormant.  But as the child gets older, the gifts of Baptism come more and more into play.    Ezekiel 18:20 ""The soul who sins will die.  The son will not share the    guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son.  The    righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the    wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him.""    If you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesn't hold us guilty    for anyone else's sins.  So we can have no original guilt from Adam. Adam was given a number of gifts by God.  The chief among them was what Catholics call ""sanctifying grace"".  (In the New Testament, the word used for this is ""charity"".)  By his sin, Adam lost this grace. He didn't lose it just for himself, however, he lost it for the whole human race.  Because once he lost it, he couldn't pass it on to his descendents. That's why Catholics baptize babies.  Through his Original Sin, Adam lost sanctifying grace for all his descendents.  Christ instituted Baptism to give it back to everyone. Babies are not being punished for anything they personally did; they are simply lacking in something they need, in order to enter Heaven."	other

Am I mistaken with this understanding? Yes, to some degree. There was an excellent discussion in sci.skeptic on the nature of scientific work two weeks ago, I hope it did not escape your notice. The correct word is 'likely'. There is no way to be sure our models and theories are absolutely correct. Theories are backed up by evidence, but not proved - no theory can be 'true' in a mathematical sense. However, theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of phenomena. It is extremely important to test whether theories can _predict_ something new or not yet observed. All successful theories science has come up with have passed this test, including the Big Bang theory of cosmic evolution, the theory of natural selection etc. It does not mean they _must_ be correct, but they are not mere 'best fits' for the data. > = But if you claim that there must be > = an answer to ""how"" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from > = ""nothing"", science has some good candidates for an answer. > All of which require something we Christians readily admit to: ``Faith''. Well, yes, if you want to _believe_ in them. This is not what science requires - take a good look at the theory and the evidence, see if the theory has made any successful predictions, and use your reason. Disbelievers are not punished. > The fact that there are several candidates belies that *none* are conclusive. > With out conclusive evidence, we are left with faith. This is what puzzles me - why do we need to have faith in _anything_? My fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist - someone who is unable to believe, ie, fails to entertain any belief in God. Yes, I know that one can't believe without God's help; Luther makes this quite clear in his letter to Erasmus. I'm afraid this does not change my situation. > [ a couple of paragraphs deleted.

No, it is not, although it does look like one. This is a true dichotomy, either something exists, or nothing exists. If nothing exists, nobody would ask why. If something exists, it is possible to ask why, but actually no existing being could give an answer. Imagine, for a moment, that the nobodies in non-existence could also ask: ""Why nothing exists?"" This is equivalent to my counter-question, ""why nothing exists in nothingness"". Now, ""why anything exists"" is equivalent to ""why something exists in somethingness"".  _This_ is what I meant with my tautology, my apologies for the poor wording in my previous post. > I might add, the worldview of ""Things that exist do, and things that > don't...don't"" is as grounded in the realm of the non-falsifiable, > as does the theist's belief in God.

I do indeed think there probably _is_ no reason for being, or existence, in general, for reasons I stated above. However, they will still leave open the question ""why this, and not that"", and this is where theistic explanations come in. Science cannot give reasons for any _particular_ human being's existence. > We come to this. Either ""I am, therefore I am."", or ""I am for a reason."" This is a deep philosophical question - is determinism true, or not? Also, is God deterministic or not? I tend to think this question has no meaning in His case. If I am for a reason, I've yet failed to see what it would be. From our perspective, it looks like 'I' exist for truly random reasons. I just rolled two dice - why did I get 6 and 1? How can I believe there is any better reason for my existence? > If the former is a satisfactory answer, then you are done, for you are > satisfied, and need not a doctor.

No, it doesn't, but I think an existing God cannot know why He exists, for an answer to this question is not knowable. Of course, this should not be any obstacle to belief in His existence. > I also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer ""why"".   It > appears that M. Pihko agrees (as we shall see).  But because a tool is > inadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question.  Asserting > that 'why' is an invalid question does not provide an answer. It is impossible to know unknowable things. However, the question ""why do I exist, in particular"" is _not_ an invalid question - this is not what I said. But from our perspective, it is impossible to tell, and I can't just believe in any given explanation instead of another, especially since I found I was deluding myself. > My apologies.  I was using why as ""why did this come to be"".  Why did > pre-existence become existence.  Why did pre-spacetime become spacetime. I think ""pre-existence"" is an oxymoron. There is no time 'outside' of this spacetime (except in some other universe), and from that perspective, our universe never was. It exists only for those who are inside it. > But we come to the admission that science fails to answer ""Why?"".  Because > it can't be answered in the realm of modern science, does that make the > question invalid? No. The validity of the question has to be discussed separately; I think philosophy is of great help here. What can be known, and what is not knowable? > M. Pihko does present a good point though.  We may need to ask ""What do I > as an individual Christian base my faith on?""  Will it be shaken by the > production of evidence that shatters our ""sacred cows"" or will we seek to > understand if a new discovery truly disagrees with what God *said* (and > continues to say) in his Word? This is a very good question. In trying to answer this, and numerous other questions that bothered me, I finally found nothing to base my faith on. I think it would be honest if we all asked ourselves, ""why do I believe"" or ""why I don't believe"".

In the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our    neighbors. He doesn't say anything about hate. In fact, if anything, he    commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. ....    - Scott I too dislike the phrase ""Hate the sin, love the sinner"".  Maybe the definite article is also part of the problem, since it seems to give us license to fixate on our brother's peculiar pecadillo which we have managed to escape by a common grace of heredity, economic situation, or culture.  Our outrage at evil is too often just a cheap shot. That said, I don't think Scott has adequately explored the flip side of this coin, namely the love of righteousness.  In the Beatitudes, Jesus blessed those who hungered and thirsted for righteousness.  In the New Testament, it is never enough just to behave well, one should always actively desire and work for the cause of good.  In that sense, it should be impossible to remain dispassionate about evil and its victims, even when these are its accomplices as well. Maybe ""mourn sin, love sinners"" catches the idea slightly better than ""hate"", but only slightly, since grief usually implies a passive powerless position.  A balanced Christian response needs grief, love, and carefully measured, constructive anger.  Jesus has all three.  The European pietists during WWII whose response to Nazi atrocities was devoid of anger do not fare well as role models, however much love or grief they exemplified. My sister is an actress in New York and a Christian.  A few years back, Jack, her long-time professional friend and benefactor, died of AIDS, impoverished by medical bills, estranged from his family, and abandoned by most of his surviving friends.  Only my sister and brother-in-law were there with him at the very end.  In her grief over Jack's death, my sister found quite a few targets for anger: callous bureaucracies, the rigid self-protective moralism of Jack's family, the inertia in Christians' response to AIDS, and, yes, even Jack's own lapse in morality that eventually cost him his life.  Jack himself shared that last anger.  Brought up with strong Christian values, he was contrite over his brief dalliance with promiscuous sex long before his AIDS appeared.  (I imply no moral judgement here about Jack's innate sexual orientation, n.b.) Maybe the hardest job is making our anger constructive. Van Kelly vek@research.att.com"	other

The symposium will be held one week before the public opening of a major exhibition, ""Scrolls from the Dead Sea: The Ancient Library of Qumran and Modern Scholarship,"" that opens at the Library of Congress on April 29.  On view will be fragmentary scrolls and archaeological artifacts excavated at Qumran, on loan from the Israel Antiquities Authority.  Approximately 50 items from Library of Congress special collections will augment these materials.  The exhibition, on view in the Madison Gallery, through Aug. 1, is made possible by a generous gift from the Project Judaica Foundation of Washington, D.C.    The Dead Sea Scrolls have been the focus of public and scholarly interest since 1947, when they were discovered in the desert 13 miles east of Jerusalem.

What I was asking is this: Please show me that the most effective substance-absure recovery programs involve meetinsg peoples' spiritual needs, rather than merely attempting to fill peoples' spiritual needs as percieved by the people, A.A, S.R.C. regulars, or snoopy. This will probably involve defining ""spritual needs"" (is it not that clear) and showing that such things exist and how they can be filled. Annother tack you might take is to say that ""fulfilling spiritual needs"" means ""acknowledging a ""higher power"" of some sort, then show that systems that do require this, work better than otherwise identical systems that do not. A correlation here would help you, but as you point out this might just be demonstrating swapping one crutch for annother. (however, I do feel that religion is usually a better crutch than alchohol, as it is not usually poisonous! :) ) I hope with that clarification, my question will be answerable. I actually did know about the 12 step program, its the question of what it does, rather than what it tries to do, that makes a difference to me. --- 			- Dan Johnson And God said ""Jeeze, this is dull""... and it *WAS* dull.

There are some who don't want to turn over everything and be a disciple, some have no clue about it because they've not been taught, some have done exactly that and turned over everything to follow Jesus, some are blocked by difficult doctrine taught by uncaring Pharisees and teachers of the law. However, Jesus pointed out what it takes to follow him and to be his disciple in Luke 9:23-26 and Luke 14:25-33.  My question is:  why do people ignore the command and treat it as optional?

Marhaba Nabil, If we posit two minds in Christ, the mind of the logos and the mind of the human Jesus, then we must admit two wills.  A mind is not a mind without a will.  I know this has been dealt with in past Church prnouncements, but there is a philosophical problem here that should examined. T. V. Morris argued that the Incarnation can be seen like this:       _____________      (Mind of Logos)      (	 _______   )      (	(	)  )	Here, the mind of Jesus is circumsribed by God the      (	( Human	)  )	Son.  God the Son has complete access to the human      (  ( Mind	)  )	mind but the human mind only has access to the mind      (	(	)  )	of God the Son when the Son allows access.  This      (	(_______)  )	explains why Jesus said even he did not know the      (_____________)	time of the kingdom. The human will acted in accordance with the divine will according to free human decision.  But if the human will would have decided differently than what was intended the divine will would have interceded, but this was never the case. He employs some very interesting analogies to support the one person/two mind theory.  The ideas of a completely healthy version of split personality from the field of psychology, and the intriguing ideas of being in a dream, seeing yourself acting, knowing that is you, but also being omniscient. The one hypostasis would be the unity of the two minds.  Agreed.  But I am still waiting for Morris and others to respond to the lingering problem of two minds making two persons.  Christian analytic philosophers are breaking new ground in explicating the rationality of Theism and the Incarnation. ==================================== Ted Kalivoda (tedr@athena.cs.uga.edu) University of Georgia, Athens Institute of Higher Ed.

I have used Glockenspeil commonview under Motif and OS2.  I wrote a resource converter from OS2 to Motif, but it really wasn't too easy, especially the naming scheme. In Motif you cannot rename controls/widgets. With windows you can call the OK button ID_OK in every instance, this doesn't work for Motif, you'd have to call it Dialog1_OK, and Motif expects a text string rather than a number.  So your constructor should know how to convert a #define into the proper resource identifier. I'd check on how the toolkit expects names, and that if it does use resources, that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to port to. ( By the way, I would never use CommonView or Glockenspiel for anything ) Alex. -- __  __|       \      __|       Alex Colburn    |       /   \    |          Image Analysis Facility    |      _____ \   __|	       University of Iowa ______| _/      _\ _|          colburn@tessa.iaf.uiowa.edu"	comp.os.ms-windows.misc

If you are planning on using this on a regular basis, conncting the printer to file can become bothersome because Windows then asks you for the filename that you want to create. I've found that putting a line in system.ini in the ports section with just a path and filename works. The only problem is that if you send more than one job, the second one deletes the first.

I found 3 shareware Workspace Managers, from Australia's MS-WINDOWS archive (monu6.cc.monash.edu.au), which mirrors some sites in the U.S.  The three I found were: 1. WORKSPACES 1.10 (wspace.zip)                                 This was the smallest and simplest    of the workspace managers that I found.  It is very easy to use.    It displays a small window, containing 6 buttons, plus an extra    button for configuration purposes.  One annoying feature was the    title window that is first presented when it is run - you must press    a key (not a mouse button!) for the thing to go away.  Also, it would    have been nice if there was an ""ALWAYS ON TOP"" setting for the little    window containing the workspace buttons.  Maybe some user-specified    strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be    a nice feature.  The simplicity and ease of use of this workspace    manager makes it an attractive package. 2. WORKSHIFT 1.6 (wrksft16.zip)                                While this workspace manager offered a    few features that WORKSPACES 1.10 lacked, it was quite time consuming    to set things up.  With WORKSPACES 1.10, all but the first workspace    is initially empty.  With WORKSHIFT 1.6, you need to take ""snapshots""    of how you want each of your workspaces to look like - i.e. what    applications they contain.  Also, the main window is quite large,    but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace.    With WORKSPACES 1.10, there was no facility for viewing what was in    a workspace without switching to it.  WORKSHIFT 1.6 provides this    viewing functionality which is quite useful. 3. BIGDESK 2.30 and BACKMENU (backdesk.zip)                             This is an interesting package, which contains    a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager.  Other goodies    include ""Backmenu"", which provides a pop-up root menu when you    press a certain mouse button - just like in X-Windows.  The menu    is totally configurable, offering unlimited depth of cascading menus,    which is provides quite handy access to applications.  You could    say it is a menu-based alternative to the program manager.  Also    bundled in ""backdesk.zip"" is a program called ""WRUN"", which allows    you to run windows applications from a DOS shell under WINDOWS    instead of using the File Manager to run applications.    The actual workspace manager is called BIGDESK 2.30.  BIGDESK works quite    differently to the other two workspace managers in that it    doesn't provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces.    In fact, it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount,    and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to    focus in on.  This means you can have windows overlapping between different    viewing regions, unlike the first two workspace managers in which    each workspace was isolated from the other one.  The BIGDESK control window    allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop.  Basically    the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area    while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow-up    of a particular section. Try each of them out for yourself.  I was impressed with all of them, so find out which one suits your needs the best."	comp.os.ms-windows.misc

Here's my question: CONTEXT: I use a package called SLIP on my home computer to connect to the          university mainframe (an IBM 3090 running VMS/MVS), and log on to my          account. When I installed SLIP on my computer, I had to configure it          for my modem (14.4 kbs Etronics internal) and had to supply the phone          number to dial to reach the mainframe. The way it works now is that          I type ""telnet uicvm"" or ""tn3270 uicvm"" (either will work) at the DOS          prompt. UICVM is the node name of the mainframe. The program then          dials the mainframe, establishes a protocol, and gives me the logon          screen. ""TELNET"" and ""TN3270"" are the names of batch files in my SLIP          directory. I have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the          session. PROBLEM: I would like to be able to do all this under Windows 3.1 because I          hardly ever use DOS directly. SLIP will not run under Windows. I          talked to the people at our computer center, and they suggested that          I use a packet driver called WINPKT.COM with SLIP. They gave me          instructions on how to load it before I start Windows, and how to          modify the TCPSTART and TCPSTOP batch files (in the SLIP directory)          to ensure that it would work. I did all that and I could run SLIP          from Windows, but there were other problems. For one thing, SLIP          would not hang up the phone when I exited. I had to run my communi-          cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when          that didn't work. For another, there were too many errors. It often          took me 3-4 tries to connect to the mainframe. Our computer center          does not support SLIP under Windows, so I can't keep going back to          them with more questions. QUESTION: Is there some other SHAREWARE package that will run under Windows          and do what SLIP is supposed to do? I need a package that is not too          expensive, which is why I am looking for shareware. I have heard that          there are regular commercial packages that do all this, but they cost          hundreds of dollars. These are the main requirements:          1. Must be able to run under Windows 3.1          2. Must allow VT100 and IBM TN3270 terminal emulation          3. Must allow ftp file transfers, since that's the only kind the             mainframe allows. No Y-modem or Z-modem etc. I believe the ftp             transfers are made through a kermit protocol, but I'm hazy about             that.          A subsidiary feature (that would be nice to have) if it's a true          Windows program (rather than a DOS program modified to run under          Windows) is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently          with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet          session and other applications. Any information received is appreciated. Pankaj Saxena u09416@uicvm.uic.edu"	comp.os.ms-windows.misc

Well, these ""statistics"" are to shut people up and add some 	microscopic weight to MS' arguments.  As I just said, you have 	seen what automakers do.

Was it 	because (as the WSJ says) he couldn't wait to use what he 	knew to go out and make money?  Bill Gate's answer to this 	question would be highly interesting.  I await it. 	I can't stomach Bill declaring himself a visionary and 	using every available opportunity to build up the cult 	around himself and then having MS sell DOS and Windoze 	as their main stays.  --------------------------------------------- |kenton+@CMU.EDU | OS/2 FIXES BROKEN WINDOWS |  ---------------------------------------------"	comp.os.ms-windows.misc

Don't know on the last one. And why they are considering using WinBench as a test, they may want to read everything Steve Gibson has said on the subject in his InfoWorld column the past couple of month.  In short, virtually every board manufacturer cheats on the test by writing things in the driver that is there only to make the board appear faster on the WinBench suite.  So the WinBench score has no bearing in reality to how cards stack up on real world tasks. In the last PC-Magazine they benchmarked some of the new accelerators, and admitted that many of them 'cheated' on WinBench.  Interestingly, they 'allowed' one type of cheating behaviour (caching for bitblt operations, no matter how unreal), yet did not allow a couple of other types of cheating behaviour that some of the cards used.  At least one card was eliminated from the ""Editor's Choice"" because of cheating on the benchmark. >Al DeVilbiss >al@col.hp.com"	comp.os.ms-windows.misc

When using the windows terminal application, the only way I can get it to 'see' the modem is to change it to COM2, then go back and change it to COM4.  Then it works fine. (I have it set to COM4 as the port to use)  I don't have anything plugged into COM2, and I've looked over the manual for all it's worth, but what am I missing?  The modem is jumpered for COM4/IRQ3, which I understand means I can't use the second serial port and the modem at the same time, but I'm not using the second serial port anyway. Also, when using Procomm + for DOS, it always sees the modem and dials, but doesn't always connect me when the other end answers.  Don't know if that helps any. Thanks,  Brian D.

Yet, Write does >display the font correctly on the screen. This is a common problem with highly complex TrueType fonts.  Microsoft admits to a problem with older versions of the PostScript printer driver, but I've found it to be pretty generic. You can get around the problem by adjusting the parameter OutlineThreshold in the [TrueType] section of WIN.INI.  This entry specifies the number of pels-per-em at which Windows will render TrueType fonts as outline fonts instead of as bitmap fonts.  The default is 256.  I've generally been able to get fonts to work by setting OutlineThreshold=160.  Depending on your printer resolution and the point size you are using, you may need a different value. The Windows Resource Kit warns against going above 300.  Presumably, that might cause fonts to print as square boxes or something.  :-|  (I'm not smiling.) -- Bob Nichols AT&T Bell Laboratories rnichols@ihlpm.ih.att.com	comp.os.ms-windows.misc

I have a 286 with a GVGA-16 video board.  I've been using the standard Windows VGA driver with other similarly configured computers. I am thinking that my problem is with the way Windows refreshes it's screen. The problem is that once Windows has been envoked, the colors start changing themselves.  At first I thought it was hardware, but if you open a full screen DOS program from within the Windows session, you don't have any problems until you get back to Windows - however, when you initially return to Windows, the original colors get refreshed properly. Also, it is not a uniform color change - so if you are in solitaire, the design on the back of the card maintains it's original color scheme, but the white fronts of the cards will turn grey, then blue, etc. The color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark purple-ish black.  If you pop out to DOS and exit back to Windows - the screen gets refreshed again. If I don't log into Windows and just do DOS things from the Novell network, everything is fine. I originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the other machine I had just finished configuring, then from the net to this machine.  When I ran into problems, I deleted everything on this machine and the net, and tried bouncing it again.  When that didn't work, I tried reloading Windows to no avail. Any thoughts on things to check out?  I am totally baffled! Thanks in advance for any assistance and instruction! Linda Cornell lcornell@u.washington.edu UW Office of Research	comp.os.ms-windows.misc

There are some things you might be interested to know about today's RISC processors.  It is true that there are fewer instructions, but what is not commonly known is that this causes the size of your executables to swell, so that in some cases performance is similar for larger applications. As a compromise, many RISC processors today are actually a cross between a Reduced Instructions Set, and a Complex one.

They will scale, dither and convert GIFs to BMPs. get the index file from the win3 subdir too for future reference... Step 2: ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu or plaza.aarnet.edu.au or archive.orst.edu and cd to graphics/gif GET THE INDEX FILE... Now GigaBytes of pictures are waiting to become your desktop...

You can set up different config.sys and autoexec.bat commands for each user, and they just have to select their menu option on bootup.  Then you can have the autoexec.bat copy the win.ini and system.ini files and change directories for them.  When they exit windows, it can copy back generic .ini files if you want. This is the only way I can think of.

I now have about 8 different groups in program manager but it seems that everytime I install something new that makes a new group, it promptly disappears after I turn of windows! This happened when I installed Excel and WinFax Pro v.3. They both created their own groups but when I turned off windows and reran them, they were gone. I had to manually pull them up as new items and put them in a previously existing group as all new gropus disappear as soon as I turn off windows. 	my set up: 			precision 386dx-25 w/ 4 megs 			Trident 8900c with 1 meg 			Windows 3.1 running in 800x600 colour mode 			logitech mouseman Thank you in advance!

Reguarding image >quality and resolution - I have not seen much better. Please do not do this! I don't know how the rest of you read news, but here's how I do it:  I subscribe to an ""outernet"" system which allows me to dial up via modem and download e-mail and news articles automatically.  When someone posts a huge attached binary file, I have no choice but to receive it along with all the other new articles in the groups I subscribe to.  I also pay for the connect time, which is normally not a problem because I have a 14.4K modem and each day's upload/download session takes only 5 minutes or so. Today's session, however, lasted about 25 minutes because of ROMAN.BMP. Consequently, it cost me about $3.00 extra just to receive a file that I didn't want in the first place. If you have cool bitmaps that you want to make available, there are other ways to do it:  either upload the file to an ftp site (like ftp.cica.indiana.edu, which has a complete Windows section) and tell people how to get to it, or use one of the newsgroups like alt.binaries.pictures (or something like that), which are file archives rather than discussion groups.  Don't use discussion groups like this one to send out attached files, especially when they're 600K in size. Thanks Ed Klein eklein@spiff.win.net"	comp.os.ms-windows.misc

The argument was 1) Defense, or runs allowed, is 50% of the game. 2) Unearned runs amount to 12% of the runs allowed; earned runs, 88%. 3) Since unearned runs are the result of fielding, not pitching, and earned runs are the product of pitching, not fielding, fielding is 12% of defense and pitching is 88% of defense. 4) Caombining with #1, pitching is 44% of the game, fielding 6%. Pete is usually sharper than that. My own feel is that fielding is in the 25-33% of defense range; call it 30-70 between fielding and pitching. >One also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning, with the >split probably somewhere around 49.5% and 0.5%. I'd give baserunning a little more credit than that, maybe 45-5, or even 40-10. Give a team of Roberto Alomar and a team of John Oleruds identical batting stats (which wouldn't be that unreasonable), and even if you don't let Roberto steal a single base, they'll score a lot more than the Oleruds by going first-to-third more often.

Both have hung around for years, and continue to post great stats.  Why shouldn't Dave Kingman get into the Hall?  Or Murray, Evens, Reardon, and others?  What the hell do you have to do?

Sorry this is after Opening Day.  I certify that these were completed before the first pitch. :-) AL East 1.  New York Yankees - the most (only?) improved team in this division 2.  Toronto Blue Jays - Stewart and Morris?  No way. 3.  Milwaukee Brewers - they always seem to do better than I expect 4.  Baltimore Orioles - Pitching, but Devareaux, Anderson, and Hoiles will drop 5.  Cleveland Indians - Still don't seem to know what they are doing 6.  Detroit Tigers - All key players but Fryman are another year past peak 7.  Boston Red Sox - Any team with Clemens and Viola might be beter than 7th Al West - this division was the toughest for me to pick.  Whoever of the top           4 gets pitching should win it. 1.  Minnesota Twins - young pitchers seem to have best chance for success 2.  Texas Rangers - I don't know why I have them here.  Jose Canseco? 3.  Chicago White Sox - Frank Thomas but no pitching. 4.  Oakland A's - LaRussa is the best manager and would keep any team close 5.  Seattle Mariners - I like Pinella, but don't see much here 6.  Kansas City Royals - will score no runs 7.  California Angels - will win no games NL East 1.  Montreal Expos - good all around, plus no Wallach! 2.  St. Louis Cardinals - (Jeffries + Whiten) >> (Jose + Clark), no Galarraga 3.  Pittsburgh Pirates - youngsters will take up more slack than expected 4.  New York Mets - some good players, still not a ""team"" 5.  Philadelphia Phillies - they don't impress me 6.  Florida Marlins - they know what they're doing 7.  Chicago Cubs - they don't know what they're doing NL West - The 2 best teams in baseball are in this division. 1.  Atlanta Braves - Awesome starters, but offense could be a concern 2.  Cincinnati Reds - Would not surprise me if they won it all 3.  Houston Astros - Any team that signs Uribe won't contend. Closer to 4 than 2 4.  San Diego Padres - Plantier could be the Sheffield of 1993 5.  Los Angeles Dodgers - better pitching than the Giants 6.  San Francisco Giants - because the Rockies just stink 7.  Colorado Rockies - will become the Seattle Mariners of the NL. NLCS  Montreal d. Atlanta  (Braves fans, yes I'm probably contradicting                             what I said in my NL West comment.) ALCS  New York d. Minnesota World Series  New York d.

That is *your* opinion that Sabo is ""clearly a better hitter"" than Samuel.  The above data is for a 4-year period ending last season. Last season Samuel batted .272 while Sabo hit .244 (not park adjusted). This season they are both hitting below .200, albeit Sabo with more at bats.  I will agree that over his career Sabo has been a better hitter than Samuel, but I will also remind you that Samuel has been a better hitter in certain situations than Sabo. I did not predict that Sabo would choke, nor that Samuel would get a hit.  I expressed my opinion that had I been the Reds manager (or even a Reds fan) that I would prefer to have Samuel hit in that situation than Sabo. >>If you were to have been the Reds manager at that time, I assume you >>would have had some basis for letting Sabo hit rather than pinch- >>hitting Samuel.

But if you were interested in a reason why I expect Chris Sabo's ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one year to the next, I think I could.  If you were interested in a reason why I expect Joe Carter's ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one year to the next, I think I could.

As it happens, I also have an *opinion* that in certain situations, for certain players, a history of superior or inferior ability to hit in the clutch might suggest a reason what such history could be valid in projecting future player performance.

This certainly isn't irrelevant, and iif you replace Morris with replacement level quality the Blue Jays might not win. Re leadership, I don't see it.  If the leadership effect is there for a starting pitcher, you would expect to see its primary effect on the pitching staff.  You would expect to see the rest of the staff improve. Instead, the rest of the staff declined. You can make a reasonable argument for Winfield providing leadership; the offense picked up considerably from its effectiveness the previous year.

Actually, I think the large-scale sample size is part of the problem. It seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball in regard to BA vs. Clutch BA deviation we would get some kind of bell curve.  (The X-axis being the +/- deviation in clutch hitting vs. non-clutch;  the Y-axis being the number of players.)  Certainly there would be *some* players on the extreme ends of the bell.  My *supposition* is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently (year after year) at one end of the bell or the other, then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusions about *those* players (as opposed to all baseball players).   As a counterexample to >what you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987: > >               Non-Clutch                      Clutch >               AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA > >Maldonado      1060    260     .245            254     78      .307 >Lemon          1643    457     .278            256     57      .223 > >If you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those ""clutch"" >situations, you'd bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye.  Well, in >1988, Maldonado hit .267 in ""non-clutch"" and .190 in ""clutch"", while Lemon >hit .254 in ""non-clutch"" and .313 in ""clutch"".  Before you accuse me of >completely cooking the data, You won't hear those kind of accusations from me.  It is interesting that you selected Maldonado, because he is someone whom I have also looked at.  He has been a very inconsistent hitter (in terms of BA), hitting in 1989 - 92  .217, .273, .250, .272    Admittedly, he has been traded between leagues as well as clubs.  His clutch hitting record is equally inconsistent.  So, for my purposes in 1993 I would not draw any conclusions about his ability to hit in the clutch based on his prior performance.  I don't know how I would have felt in 1988, but you may indeed be right. When I looked at Sabo I found a more consistent record of hitting, and a more consistent pattern of his clutch hitting being proportionately below his non-clutch BA.  Ditto for Joe Carter. This probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having with others on this topic.  Must any conclusion based on statistical history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before it has any validity?  Is it impossible (or irrational) to apply statistical analysis to selected components of the data base? >BTW, correlating players' _overall_ batting average from '84-'87 with >'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at >something better than the 99.9% confidence level.

I'm sure some of that basis would have utilized >prior performance.  You just wouldn't have used this particular >aspect of prior performance.  Is this not correct? Right.  I would have used aspects of prior performance which have been shown to be consistent in the past.  Overall performance, L/R splits, even matching hitting/pitching styles.  All of these will give me some advantage if used properly. EVEN IF ALL ELSE WERE EQUAL, there would be no advantage gained by looking at past clutch performance.  And in this case, everything else pointed to Sabo. >One more time.  I did *not* claim to be able to predict the future. >I said that I accept the above data as an indication that Samuel would >have had a better chance for success in that situation than Sabo. That comes down to the same thing.  When Perez left Sabo in, he was predicting the future, the next AB.  He was predicting that Sabo was more likely to get a hit than Samuel. By supporting the swap, you are predicting the opposite. >And I am not dismissing your work.  I'm stating my opinion. >You are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary >invalid, so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult >to your work. Well, yes.

I'd say this is insulting. >I did not say that it is a consistent skill. > >	I have said that it is an indicator of performance under a >	certain set of circumstances. RIGHT!  This is the beef.  It has not proven to be an indicator of future performance under *any* circumstances.  At least none that we've been able to come up with.  If you know of some where it *is* an indicator of future performance, please let us in on your secret. >It is nice, however, to see that you will consider the possibility >that you actually could have some preconceived biases. Most certainly.  As I have repeatedly stated, if you can come up with a study which even *hints* at a consistent clutch ability, I would love it!

We can then test this rule on past data to see if it worked for recent years.

Message-ID: <C5JKIK.1zF@ucdavis.edu> Sender: usenet@ucdavis.edu Organization: Julio Machado Candlelight Vigil Society Distribution: na Date: Thu, 15 Apr 1993 20:20:43 GMT Lines: 50 Was going over some videos last night..... Studying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very interesting.  And enlightening. Here's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco, circa June 1986. 1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,     not gain more bulk. 2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's     lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed. 3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like     Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is     released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -     Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his     stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,     they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard     to make adjustments in your swing. What would I do, if I were Jose? Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch, so that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing. First, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance, and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this will cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move the bathead more freely. Second, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work. Third, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find my 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling the wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength  is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of the park. If Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back problems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could still hit 600+ HR. -- *   Gary Huckabay   * ""You think that's loud enough, a$$hole?""           * *   ""Movie Rights   * ""Well, if you're having trouble hearing it, sir,   * *   available thru  *  I'd be happy to turn it up for you.

East Summary: The division has gone to the birds Keywords: last chance for foolishness Message-ID: <steph.733989466@pegasus.cs.uiuc.edu> Date: 5 Apr 93 05:57:46 GMT Article-I.D.: pegasus.steph.733989466 Sender: news@cs.uiuc.edu Organization: University of Illinois, Dept. of Comp. Sci., Urbana, IL Lines: 95 Having run completely out of time, I've got to get my prophesies and predictions for the A.L. out.  Qualifications -- one of the worse finishes in last year's prediction contest. AL East -- 1993 1.  Baltimore Orioles Why the Orioles?  Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down to this:   -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction.   -- Can't bring myself to pick the Yankees   -- Milwaukee was a fluke   -- Indians aren't ready to contend   -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn't get any better   -- Detroit's pitching will be the new definition of ""replacement level"" ""But you don't really think the Orioles will win, do you.""  No.  As a matter of fact, I can't see any team in the American League winning either division on paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate).  But some- body has to win, so I pick the Orioles.  ""You don't really think that Brady Anderson is going to repeat, do you?""  No.  I'm basing the Orioles prediction on the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis.  ""Glenn Davis?  That's insane"".  Yes.  So, without further ado: STRONG POINTS:  Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken. WEAK POINTS:  Segui may start.  Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be   the fifth starter.  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.   (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize   the effect of a slumping Ripken?  If you can't move Ripken out of the #3   spot, why not move the rest of the line up?) WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota. ObPrediction:  ""The Streak"" continues.  Harold Reynolds leads the team in   caught stealing. 2. New York Yankees. STRONG POINTS:  Abbot, Key, Perez.  Could have best pitching in American   League.  Boggs should improve on Hayes. WEAK POINTS:  Mattingly still considered best hitter.  The Steinbrenner   factor.  (The Yankees lost to the Mets.  Can wholesale changes be far   behind?)  Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to   win a division. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Boggs hits over .300 WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Howe gets arrested again. ObPrediction:  Mattingly won't top a 700 OPS. 3.  Toronto Blue Jays STRONG POINTS:  Management willing to make big deals.  Management has eerie   power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects.  Olerud.   Guzman.  Alomar. WEAK POINTS:  The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick.   Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that's *really* a bad sign).  No one in   the outfield can get on base.  Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Club makes no major deals in August. ObPrediction:  Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year.  And   have a losing record. 4.  Milwaukee Brewers STRONG POINTS:  Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year. WEAK POINTS:  Molitor gone.  Surhoff at third?  Why?  Eldred can't keep it up. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Listach and Eldred play like last year. WOULD BE BAD SIGN:  Bones plays like last year. ObPrediction:  Surhoff won't finish the year at third. 5.  Cleveland Indians STRONG POINTS:  Baerga, Belle, Nagy WEAK POINTS:  Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts.  Starts Felix   Fermin. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Bielecki's ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Ted Power -- bullpen ace. ObPrediction:  Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break. 6.  Boston Red Sox STRONG POINTS:  Clemens, Viola, Clemens, Detroit, Clemens WEAK POINTS:  Most incompetent GM in baseball.  Key free agent signing -- Andre   Dawson.  Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Rainouts in between Clemens starts. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Clemens on the DL ObPrediction:  Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon.  Interpret that how   you will :-> 7.  Detroit Tigers STRONG POINTS:  Tettleton, Phillips, Whitaker WEAK POINTS:  If Fielder keeps declining, he'll be a shortstop this year.   Worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better.   This year could be *very* ugly. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder deserving the MVP. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder not whining about deserving an MVP. ObPrediction:  Cecil *won't* lead the league in RBIs. One more division to go.... -- Dale J.

For the past year or two, the AP has been getting box scores from STATS, Inc.  The AP representative in the press box is actually a STATS reporter ($25 dollars a game, but free parking.  And anybody can do it.)  The box is downloaded to STATS in Chicago, some quick error checking is done, and then STATS sends it to the AP.  I'm not sure where the appreveiations come in hear.  I don't think it is at STATS's.  It may just be a space correction by the AP sports editor that day. While I'm mentioning STATS reporters, they are always looking for new people.  Especially if you live in Cleveland or Pittsburgh, you're road to getting into the press box may be real short.  For more info, call STATS (708) 676-3322, and ask about the reporter network.

It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five in the 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. Jamie Navarro pitched seven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado has pitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next lowest on the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch! It doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while Thon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next best hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at .238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team is 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/game and giving up 6.6/game. Still, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should come around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave the Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, Fetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be successful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either held small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay, the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen is a big question mark.

New Method For Diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease Discovered at Huntington Medical Research Institutes: Results to Be Reported  To: National Desk, Health Writer  Contact: John Lockhart or Belinda Gerber, 310-444-7000, or           800-522-8877, for the Huntington Medical Research           Institutes.    LOS ANGELES, April 28  -- A new method for diagnosing and measuring chemical imbalances in the brain which lead to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias has been discovered by researchers at the Huntington Medical Research Institutes (HMRI) in Pasadena, Calif.  Results of their research will be reported in the May issue of the scientific journal, Radiology.    Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a research team led by Brian D. Ross, M.D., D. Phil., conducted a study on 21 elderly patients who were believed to be suffering from some form of dementia. The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with special software developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS.  Clinical Proton MRS is easily applied, giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses in less than 30 minutes.  An automated version of Clinical Proton MRS called Proton Brain Examination (PROBE) reduces the examination time yet further, providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10 minutes.  By comparison, the current ""standard of care"" in testing for Alzheimer's disease calls for lengthy memory function and neuropsychological tests, which can be very upsetting to the patient, are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy.    In addition to Alzheimer's disease, the new Clinical Proton MRS exam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias, including AIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease.    ""We've developed a simple test which can be administered quickly and relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fitted with either the MRS or PROBE software,"" said Dr. Ross, adding, ""this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer's earlier and intervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease causes further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain.""    Dr. Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in the brain known as inositols, and myo-inositol (MI) acted as a marker in the study.  In comparison to healthy patients, those diagnosed with Alzheimer's showed a 22 percent increase in MI, while their level of another chemical called N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was significantly lower, indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neurons believed to be associated with the progression of the disease.    Current drug therapy for Alzheimer's disease is widely considered to be inadequate.  This is attributable, Dr. Ross believes, to the theory that Alzheimer's is caused by an interruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to the nerve cells. This belief has been adhered to over the last 15 years, and consequently, most drugs to treat Alzheimer's were based on the changing receptors for acetylcholine.    ""Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate Alzheimer's from other dementias, to provide the patient and his or her family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment protocols for the treatment of this disease.  For this reason, we consider this test a major advancement in medicine,"" said Bruce Miller, M.D., a noted neurologist at Harbor-UCLA, MRS researcher and a co-author of the study.    Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex A. Moats, Ph.D., Truda Shonk, B.S., Thomas Ernst, Ph.D., and Suzanne Woolley, R.N.  The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately 1,200 General Electric MRI units currently in use in the United States, and will be configured for other manufacturers' MRI units soon.

Q & A on Alzheimer's Disease:    What is Alzheimer's disease and how is it caused?    Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable degenerative disease of the brain first described in 1906 by the German neuropathologist Alois Alzheimer.  As the disease progresses, it leads to loss of memory and mental functioning, followed by changes in personality, loss of control of bodily functions, and, eventually, death.    How many people does it affect?    Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 4 million adults in the United States and is the fourth leading cause of death, taking approximately 100,000 lives each year.  While Alzheimer's debilitates its victims, it is equally devastating, both emotionally and financially, for patients' families.  AD is the most common cause of dementia in adults.  Symptoms worsen every year, and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset.    What are its signs and symptoms?    Although the cause of AD is not known, two risk factors have been identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition.  The risk of developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 50 yars old, but increases steeply in each successive decade of life to reach 30 percent by the age of 90.  In patients with familial AD, immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance of developing AD.  One of its first symptoms is severe ""forgetfulness"" caused by short-term memory loss.  Dr. Herman Weinreb of the School of Medicine at New York University says ""whether forgetfulness is a serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree"" and suggests the following criteria:    -- Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is       normal.    -- Forgetting the name of a loved one is serious.    -- Forgetting where you left your keys is normal.    -- Forgetting how to get home is serious.    Doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be evaluated in order to rule out Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.  -30- -- Canada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontario 416-629-7000/629-7044"	other

Dept. - New Mexico Tech Lines: 46 Nntp-Posting-Host: baltic 	For a very long time I've had a problem with feeling really awful when I try to get up in the morning.  My sleep latency at night is also pretty long,  ranging from 30 min to an hour.  I get about 7 hours of bedtime (maybe 6 of actual sleep) a night and more on the weekends.  I will spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if I can,  because I feel so tired when I wake up,  even more tired than I was when I went to bed,  which is usually too tired to work. 	Anyway,  I recently had a really bad flu,  so I called a friend to get me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant; but he got Vicks formula 44M which has everything but an expectorant.  So I used that anyway,  and the three nights I used it,  I fell asleep rapidly and felt that I got really good quality sleep -- that is,  I actually felt refreshed the next morning. 	So,  I am now trying to look into,  both in the literature and experimentally,  the use of antihistamines as sleep aids,  since I am presuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect.  The antihistamine in Vicks formula 44 is Chloriphenamine maleate,  so I bought some generic tablets of that,  and tried one last night and didn't notice any improvement.  I might try one with a little alcohol (about 1 beer) to see if it is a synergism effect.  Also,  library research seems to show that Benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongest sedative effect of what is availible OTC.  So I might also buy a generic form of that and try that;  the PDR seems to suggest that 50 mg is a good dosage level to try. 	For other medical information,  I have allergies but rarely have an allergic reaction living in New Mexico.  I also have chronically dry eyes,  which get horrible if I try to use most underarm deoderants.  I did guess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia,  so I made some changes in my diet consistent with that,  and it didn't help,  so I went back to a normal diet (Pretty diverse,  also taking vitamin supplements) 	Anyway,  I am looking for advice for the use of antihistamines as sleep aids,  and if there are any dangers of such use (Seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies by millions).  I don't want to try BZs,  because BZ addiction seems to be a serious threat,  and from what I hear,  BZ sleep quality is not good, whereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me.  I have tried some dietary tryptophan loading stuff,  and that also seems to lower sleep quality,  I seem to wake up around 4:00 or so and be in some kind of mental haze until 7:00 or 8:00.  Also,  I would be interested in any other advice for helping my problem.  (Although I've already tried many of the non-pharmacological solutions)"	other

(Although I've already tried >many of the non-pharmacological solutions) Well, I think you might want to visit a doctor who is familiar with sleep disturbances, because antihistamines only help induce sleep when they're used intermittently; they lose their sedative effect if they're used on a nightly basis.  Their anticholinergic effects (drying of secretions, relaxing effects on smooth muscle) can be problematic in some people, such as those with glaucoma or prostate enlargement. Antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or doxylamine (Unisom) are potent sedatives which are useful occasionally.  Chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton) is said to be less sedative, but 8mg seems to work well in some people.  Both chlorpheniramine and doxylamine have long half-lives compared to diphenhydramine, and so may produce a residual hangover or ""drugged"" feeling the next morning. -- Steve Dyer dyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer"	other

Med. Nutrition and I'm posting my answer here.  Only 22 medical schools in the U.S. teach courses on human nutrition.  We have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can do when candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical community. I think that the best example of where U.S. medicine is really missing the mark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is PMS.  So many women(and their husbands) suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that most physicians in the U.S. are not taught that PMS is primarily caused by diet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening.  Before shooting your flames, read the entire article and then decide if flaming is justified. From A Poster In Sci. Medi. Nutrition: > 	In a psychological anthropology course I am taking, we got > sidetracked onto a short conversation about PMS.  Some rumors shared > by several of the students included ideas that vitamin levels, sugar > intake, and caffeine intake might affect PMS symptoms. > 	Is there any data on this, or is it just so much hooey? > > Many thanks, > > Michael, I've wanted to reply to this post ever since I saw it but I got side-tracked with candida.  PMS is a lot like Candida blooms, most physicians don't recognize it as a specific ""disease"" entity.  Here is everything that you would ever want to know about PMS. Premenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups: 	PMT-A(Anxiety)		PMT-D(depression) 	anxiety			depression 	irritability		forgetfulness 	insomnia		confusion 	depression		lethargy 	PMT-C(Craving)		PMT-H(Hyperhydration) 	craving for sweets	weight gain 	increased appetite	breast congestion and tenderness 	sugar ingestion causes: abdominal bloating and tenderness 	 1. headache		edema of the face and extremities 	 2. palpitations 	 3. fatigue or fainting PMT-A is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low progesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women's cycle. PMT-C is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple carbohydrates.  During the luteal phase of a women's cycle, there is increased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose challenge.  The metabolic findings believed to be responsible for PMT-C are a low magnesium and a low prostaglandin E1.  This condition of hypoglycemia is not unique to PMS but there are a number of different causes of hypoglycemia, magnesium and PGE1 seem to be specific to PMS hypoglycemia. 	A. Am. J. Psychiatry 147(4):477-80(1990). Unrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar, magnesium supplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation(increased to 5-6% of the total calories) using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources of alpha linoleic acid. PMT-D is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase of a women's cycle.  Another cause of PMT-D has been found to be lead toxicity(in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase). ""Effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human endometrial cystol"" Fertil. Steril. 28:312-18(1972). PMT-H is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated serum aldosterone level.  Salt restriction, B6, magnesium and vitamin E for breast tenderness have all been effective in treating PMT-H This general discussion of the PMS syndromes came form: 	A. ""Management of the premenstrual tension sundromes: Rational for 	    a nutritional approach"". 1986, A Year in Nutritional Medicine. 	    J. Bland, Ed. Keats, Publishing, 1986. 	B. ""Nutritional factors in the etiology of premenstrual tension 	    syndromes"", J. Reprod. Med.28(7):446-64(1983). 	C. ""Premenstrual tension"", Prob. Obstet. Gynecol. 3(12):1-39(1980) Treatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can find a doctor who will treat you for PMS(just about as hard as finding one that will treat you for candida blooms).  While progesterone will work, supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better.  There really has been an awful lot of research done on PMS(much more than candida blooms).  Many of these studies have been what are called experimental controlled studies(the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to see done). Here are a few of these studies: 	CARBOHYDRATE: Experimental Controlled Study, ""Effect of a low-fat, 	high-carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy"" Lancet 	2:128-32(1988).  21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy 	of at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive 	specific training to reduce dietary fat to 15% of total calories 	and increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary 	advise with no training.  After 6 months, there was a significant 	reduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in 	the trained group as reported by self-reported symptoms as well as 	physical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling, 	tenderness and nodularity. 	VITAMIN A: Experimental Controlled Study, ""The use of Vitamin A in 	premenstrual tension"" Acta Obstet. Gynecol Scand. 39:586-92(1960). 	218 pts with severe recurring PMS received 200,000 to 300,000IU 	vitamin A daily or a placebo.  Serum retinol levels were monitored 	and high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of 	toxicity occured(serum retinol above 450ug/ml).  The intent of the 	study was to load the liver up with vitamin A and get a normal pool 	size(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU) and then see if this 	normal vitamin A pool could prevent PMS.  48% getting the high dose 	vitamin A had complete remission of the symptoms of PMS.  Only 10% 	getting the placebo reported getting complete relief of PMS sysmptoms.   	10% of the vitamin A treated group reported no improvement in PMS 	symptoms. 	Experimental Controlled Study, ""Premenstrual tension treated with 	vitamin A"" J. Clinical Endocrinology 10:1579-89(1950). 30 pts 	received 200,000IU of vitamin A daily starting on day 15 of their 	cycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of PMS symptoms.   	After 2-6 months, all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in 	PMS symptoms.  Vitamin A supplementation was stopped once evidence of 	toxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year 	after high dose vitamin A supplementation was stopped.  PMS symptoms 	did not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the 	vitamin A supplementation was stopped. Most Americans do not have a normal store of vitamin A in their liver. These studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal store of vitamin A into the liver could eliminate PMS.  Of all the vitamins given for PMS(vitamin A, B6, and vitamin E), vitamin A has shown the best single effect.  This is probably because vitamin A is involved in steroid (estrogen/progesterone) metabolism in the liver.  Getting your liver full of vitamin A seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent the symptoms of PMS.  But vitamin A is toxic and you don't want to be trying to do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin A toxicity. 	VITAMIN B6: Experimental Double-blind Crossoverr Study, ""Pyridoxine 	(vitamin B6) and the premenstrual syndrome: A randomized crossover 	trial""J.R. Coll. Gen. Pract. 39:364-68(1989).  32 women aged 18-49 	with moderate to severe PMS randomly received 50mg B6 daily or placebo.   	After 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another 	3 months.  B6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of 	PMS(depression, irritability and tiredness).  Other symptoms of PMS 	were not significanttly affected by B6 supplementation. 	Experimental Double-blind Study, ""The efects of vitamin B6 	supplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms"" Obstet. Gynecol 	70(2):145-49(1987).  55 pts with moderate to severe PMS received 	150mg B6 daily or placebo for 2 months.  Analysis of convergence 	showed that B6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related 	to the autonomic nervous system(dizziness and vomiting) as well as 	behavior changes(poor mental performance, decreased social interaction)   	Anxiety, depression and water retention were not improved by B6 	supplementation. Vitamin B6 is below the RDA for both American men and women.  Birth control pills and over 40 different drugs increase the B6 requirement in man. Women on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10-15 mg of B6 per day.  The dose should be increased if symptoms of PMS appear.  Dr. David R. Rubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of NIMH was quoted in Clin. Psychiatry News, December, 1987 as stating that B6 should be considered the ""first-line"" drug for PMS(over progesterone) and if the patient does not respond, then other treatments should be tried.  Vitamin B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if consumed in doses of 500mg or more each day. 	VITAMIN E: Experimental Double-blind Study, ""Efficacy of alpha- 	tocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome"" J. Reprod. 	Med. 32(6):400-04(1987). 35 pts received 400IU vitamin E daily for 3 	cycles or a placebo.  Vitamin E treated pts had 33% who reported a 	significant reduction in physical symptoms(weight gain and breast 	tenderness) while the placebo group had 14% who reported a significant  	reduction in physical symptoms. The vitamin E group reported that 38% 	had a significant reduction in anxiety versus 12% for the placebo 	group.  For depression, the vitamin E group had 27% with a significant 	decrease in depression compared with 8% for the placebo group. 	Experimental Double-blind Study, ""The effect of alpha-tocopherol on 	premenstrual symptomalogy: A double blind study"" J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 	2(2):115-122(1983). 75pts with benign breast disease and PMT randomly 	received vitamin E at 75IU, 150IU, or 300IU daily or placebo.  After 	2 months of supplementation, 150IU of vitamin E or higher significantly 	improved PMT-A and PMT-C.  The 300IU dose was needed to significantly 	improve PMT-D.  No dose of vitamin E significantly improved PMT-H 	(other studies have shown that a higher vitamin E doses will relieve 	PMT-H symptoms). 	MAGNESIUM: Experimental Double-blind Study, ""Magnesium prophylaxis 	of menstrual migraine: effects on itracellular magnesium"" Headache 	31:298-304(1991). 20 pts with perimenstrual headache received 360 mg 	daily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a 	placebo.  Treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and 	continued until menstruation. After 2 months, the Pain Total Index 	was significantly lower in the magnesium group.  Magnesium treatment 	was also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the Menstrual 	Distress Questionnaire scores.  Pretreatment magnesium levels in 	lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower 	in this group of 20 pts compared to control women who did not suffer 	from PMS.  After treatment, magnesium levels in these cells was raised 	into the normal range. 	Experimental Double-blind Study, ""Oral Magnesium successfully 	relieves premenstrual mood changes"" Obstet. Gynecol 78(2):177-81(1991). 	32pts aged 24-39 randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid 	360mg of Mg per day or a placebo from the 15th day of the cycle to the 	onset of the menstrual flow.  After 2 cycles, both groups received 	magnesium.  The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster 	pain was significantly reduced during the second cycle(month) for the 	magnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were 	switched to magnesium supplementation.  In addition, the total score on 	the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire was significantly decreased by 	magnesium supplementation.  The authors suggest that magnesium 	supplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes 	that occur during PMS. There are numerous observational studies that have been published in the medical literature which also suggest that PMS is primarily a disorder that arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature.  But since observational studies are considered by most physicians in Sci. Med. to be anecdotal in nature, I have not bothered to cite them.  There are also over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on multivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent PMS.  I've chosen the best specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out that PMS is primarily a nutritional disorder.  But doctors don't recognize nutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology(beri-beri, pellagra, scruvy, etc.).  PMS is probably the best reason why every doctor being trained in the U.S. should get a good course on human nutrition.  PMS is really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional disorders.  It's time that medicine woke up and smelled the roses. Here's some studies which show the importance in multivitamin/mineral supplementation and/or diet change in preventing PMS. 	Experimental Study, ""Effect of a nutritional programme on 	premenstrual syndrome: a retrospective analysis"", Complement. Med. 	Res.5(1):8-11(1991).  200pts were given dietary instructions and 	supplemented with Optivite(R) plus additional vitamin C, vitamin E, 	magnesium, zinc and primrose oil.  The dietary instructions were to 	take the supplements and switch to a low fat, complex carbohydrate 	diet.  On a retrospective analysis, 96.5% of the 200pts reported an 	improvement in their PMS symptoms with 30% of the sample stating that 	they no longer suffered from PMS. 	Experimental Double-blind Study, ""Role of Nutrition in managing 	premenstrual tension syndromes"", J Reprod. Med. 32(6):405-22(1987). 	A low fat, high complex carbohydrate diet along with Optivite 	supplementation significantly decreased PMS scores compared with diet 	change and placebo.  After 6 months on the experimental program, the 	vitamin/mineral supplementated group had significantly decreased 	estradiol and increased progesterone in serum during the midlutel 	phase of their cycle. 	Experimental Double-blind Study, ""Clinical and biochemical effects 	of nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome"", J. 	Reprod. Med. 32(6):435-41(1987). 119pts randomly given Optivite(12 	tablets per day) or a placebo.  The treated groups showed a 	significant decrease in PMS symptoms compared to the placebo.  Another  	group of 104pts got Optivite(4 tablets per day) or placebo.  For this 	second group of patients, no significant effect of supplementation on 	PMS symptoms was observed.

I'm very surprised that medical schools still push routine circumcision of newborn males on the population. Since your friend is not a man, she can't imagine what it's like to have a penis, much less a foreskin. I guess if American medicine did an artistic job of circumcising every male, then the visual result would be somewhat more natural in appearance... The penile cancer thing has been *completely* debunked...she must be going to school on a South Pacific island. Tell her to check the Journal or Urology for circumcision articles. I remember at least 1 on an old Jewish man (cut at birth) who developed penile cancer....I mean, if the cancer risk was that great, the Europe who have been circumcising like crazy, too. Teaching a boy how to keep his cockhead clean is the issue: a little proper hygiene goes a long way - Americans are just too hung up on the penis to consider cleaning it: that's just way too much like mastubation. So you have surgical intervention that is basically unnecessary.	other

Set the follow-up (line in the header, depending on what kind of advice you give, or (e-mail directly to me: ceci@lysator.liu.se.) I have a problem with wasps -- they seem to love me. Last summer I couldn't spend more than ten to fifteen minutes at a time in my garden before one or several wasps would come for me. I am asking for advice on how to repel wasps.    This year the wasps have built their nest under a stone next to one of my tiny ponds. The caretaker (poor fellow!) will have to take care of them, and that will give me a head start on them. Last year we couldn't find any nest. Even after the caretaker has gassed the nest in my tiny garden of 30 square meter, other wasps will most likely vie for the territory. Is there anything I can grow, rub on my skin or spread on the soil that will repel the black and yellow bastards? Never mind if it turns my skin purple or kills off all my beloved plants, I want to be able to spend time in my garden like everyone else.    Would it help to remove the ponds and the bird bath? The wasps seem to come to drink at them, and I suppose that their prey will breed in them. The black tits seem to be afraid of the wasps, because as soon as the wasp season starts, they stop coming to have their bath. Even when I am not trying to win back my patio from 15-20 wasps, they seem to love me. The advice I usually get when I ask what to do about wasps, is to stand still and not wave my arms. I've got some painful stings when trying to follow that advice. I have also tried to use hygienic products without perfumes, to no avail. They still love me, and come for me, even when I'm in the middle of a crowd. So far only two things seem to work: To kill it dead or to run into the house and close all doors and windows. NB: I don't have a problem with bees or bumble-bees, just wasps.

I have never tried to force my type of medicine on any of you. Why  should I?  My patients are happy. I'm happy. You and your peers seem  to be the only miserable ones around bemoaning the steady loss of  patients to the alternative camp.  Just look at Europe. There has been a steady exodus from 'synthetic'  medicine for over a decade now, and it'll be just a matter of time  before more people on this continent will abandon their drug and white  coat worship as well and visit different doctors for different needs.

This is very interesting. I have come exactly to the same conclusions  but in regards to *conventional* medicine.  You see, I don't just treat little old ladies that wouldn't know any  different of what is being done, but a bulk of my patients consist of  teachers, lawyers, judges, nurses, accountants, university graduates,  and various health practitioners.  If these people have gotten results with my method after having been  unsuccessful with yours or their own, I certainly wouldn't lose any  sleep over whether you or your peers approve of my treatments ---  let's face it, with all the blunders committed by ""scientific"" MDs  over the years, I know a lot of people who hold your *scientific*  method in much lower esteem than they hold mine!

Sorry, but I'm not familiar OR interested with what appears to be  'NEW AGE' medicine (ayurveda, crystals), with the exception of homeo-  pathy, of which I took a course. But Gordon, you already knew that -  you just wanted to make my system look a bit more far out, right?  I use homeopathy very little, since my cellular test (EMR) is hard to  beat for accuracy and minerals are more predictable, while homeopathy  does have a problem with reliability, especially in acute conditions.  An exception perhaps are homeopathic nosodes which act fairly quickly  and are more dependable in certain viral or bacterial situations.

I have met the challenges of hundreds of sceptics by verifying the  accuracy of measuring their mineral status to their total satisfac-  tion --- in other words EVERYONE INVOLVED is happy!  If you were to cook a meal, would you worry over whether EVERYONE  in this world would find it to their liking, or only those that end  up eating it?  Since I have financed every research project that I have undertaken  entirely myself, I don't need to follow any of your rules or guide-  lines to satisfy any aspects of a grant application, which YOU may  have to; neither am I concerned of whether or not my study designs  meet your or anyone else's criteria or acceptance.

I think there would be more justification for an uneducated person  growing up in an uncivilized environment to believe in a flat earth,  than for a civilized, well educated and scientifically trained mind  to follow the doctrine of evolution.  Genetic engineering of course is now the final frontier to show God  how it is (properly) done. Now we've become capable of creating our  own paradise and give disease (and God) the boot, right?  But just before we get rid of Him for good, perhaps He could leave us  some pointers on how to solve a couple of tiny problems, such as war,  poverty, racism, crime, riots, substance abuse... And one last thing,  could He also give us a hint on how to control natural disasters, the  weather, and last, but not least --- peace?    --Ron-- ---    RoseReader 2.00  P003228:  The Lab called: Your brain is ready.

The degree of elevation (in the serum transaminases) can be trivial, or as much as ten times normal. Other blood chemistries are usually normal. As a rule, patients with CPH have no clinical signs of liver disease. Chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, at least initially, and that's why it's important to tell them apart by means of a biopsy. The patient with CPH only needs to be reassured. The patient with CAH needs to be treated. ====================================== Howard Doyle doyle+@pitt.edu	other

Message-ID: <25APR199316225142@fsphy1.physics.fsu.edu> Organization: Florida State University - School of Higher Thought News-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.4-b1 First, I'm sorry to hear that you have had to see your grandmother go through this.  I know it has to have been tough. There are many things that can cause long term confusion in elderly adults.  The change in environment can cause problems.  Anesthetic agents can cause confusion because the body cannot clear the medicines out of the body as easily.  In addition, medications and interactions between medications can cause confusion. As far as whether or not haldol can have long lasting effects even after the drug has been discontinued, I do not know.  I have not _seen_ anything to that effect.  However, I also had not been looking for that information. I can see what I can find... I can tell you that haldol is an antipsychotic drug, and, according to the Nursing93 Drug handbook, it is ""Especially useful for agitation associated with senile dementia""  (p. 400).  It also should not be discontinued abruptly.  It did not say anything about long lasting effects. Because so many things can cause confusion, it is hard for me to know what else was going on at the time; if I had more history, i might be able to answer you better.  If you want to send me e-mail with more information, I would be happy to try to  help you piece together what might have happened. Elisa picl25@fsphy1.physics.fsu.edu"	other

That's a somewhat overbroad statement.  I'm sure there are HMOs in which the fees for lab tests are subtracted from the doctor's income.  In most, however, including the one I work for, there is no direct incentive to under-order.  Profits of the group are shared among all partners, but the group is so large that an individual's generated costs have a miniscule effect.  I don't believe that we under-order.  Then again, I'm not really sure what the right amount of ordering is or should be.  Relative to the average British neurologist, I suspect that I rather drastically over-order. ---  . SLMR 2.1 .

There is no indication for IV acyclovir for shingles in an otherwise healthy person.  The oral form can help to reduce the length of symptoms, and may even help prevent the development of post-herpetic neuralgia, but I certainly would not subject someone to IV therapy without a good reason.

Distribution: usa Date: Sun, 25 Apr 93 00:38:53 GMT Lines: 124 The following article by columnist Mike Royko is his humorous commentary on some of the public's perception of doctors and their salaries. I hope some of you will find it as amusing as I did. ____________________________________________________________________________ [Reprinted w/o permission] ""There's no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors' salaries"" By Mike Royko Tribune Media Services      On a stupidity scale, a recent poll about doctors' earnings is right up there.  It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10.      It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called Families USA.       The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believe that doctors make too much money.      The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for physicians.  Those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would be OK.      How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid.      Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based on resentment and envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign and are still simmering.      You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that earns $100,000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majority of Americans don't make those bucks,  they assume that those  who do are stealing it from them.      Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down,  but don't  kid  yourself. Karl Marx lives.      It's also stupid because it didn't ask key  questions,  such as:  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  to become a physician?      If those polled said no,  they didn't know, then they should have  been disqualified.   If they gave the wrong  answers,  they should have been dropped.   What good are their views on how much a doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become a doctor?      Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  ""How much  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellent grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  order to (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  taking courses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work and maintain a 3.5 average or better,  and (c) spend four more  years of  grinding study in medical school,  with the third and  fourth years in clinical training,  working 80 to 100 hours a week,  and (d) spend another year as a low-pay,  hard-work intern,  and  (e) put  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training, depending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100,000  in debt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60 hours  a week,  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  or more until they retire or fall over?""      As  you have probably guessed by now,  I  have  considerably more  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  and Clinton,  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  have called together to remake America's health care.      Based  on what doctors contribute to society,  they are  far more useful than the power-happy,  ego-tripping, program-spewing, social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is to health what Clinton's first budget is to frugality.      But propaganda works.   And,  as the stupid poll  indicates, many Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  the major cause of high medical costs.      Of  course doctors are well-compensated.   They  should  be. Americans now live longer than ever.   But who is responsible for our longevity--lawyers,  Congress, or the guy flipping burgers in a McDonald's?      And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  become a  nation  of  self-indulgent,   lard-butted,   TV-gaping   couch cabbages.      Ah,  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  or Super  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   But instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain, they might have been more honest if they had said:      ""Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggest problems we have.   That problem is you, my fellow American. Yes, you,  eating  too much and eating the wrong foods;  many  of  you guzzling  too  much hooch;  still puffing away at $2.50  a  pack; getting  your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to  the microwave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies into the  world;  filling  the big city emergency rooms  with  gunshot victims;  engaging  in unsafe sex and catching a  deadly  disease while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure.      ""You  and  your habits,  not the  doctors,  are  the  single biggest  health  problem in this country.   If  anything,  it  is amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do.      ""In fact,  I don't understand how they can stand looking  at your blubbery bods all day.      ""So as your president,  I call upon you to stop whining  and start living cleanly.   Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy- greasy with double fries.  Do as I say, not as I do.""      But  for those who truly believe that doctors are  overpaid, there is another solution: Don't use them.      That's right.   You don't feel well?   Then try one of those spine poppers,  needle twirlers, or have Rev. Bubba lay his hands upon your head and declare you fit.      Or  there is the do-it-yourself approach.   You  have  chest pains?   Then sit in front of a mirror,  make a slit here, a slit there, and pop in a couple of valves.      You're  going to have a kid?   Why throw your money at  that overpaid  sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger  house than  you  will  ever  have  (while  paying  more  in  taxes  and malpractice insurance than you will ever earn)?      Just have the kid the old-fashioned way.   Squat and do  it. And if it survives,  you can go to the library and find a book on how to give it its shots.      By  the  way,  has  anyone  ever done a  poll  on  how  much pollsters should earn?

I was diagnosed last May w/Crohn's of the terminal ileum. When I got out of the hospital I read up on it a bit, and came across several studies investigating the role of EPA (an essentially FA) in reducing inflammation. The evidence was mixed. [Many of these studies are discussed in ""Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"" MacDermott, Stenson. 1992.] But if I recall correctly, there were some methodological bones to be picked with the studies (both the ones w/pos. and w/neg. results). In the studies patients were given EPA (a few grams/day for most of the studies), but, if I recall correctly, there was no restriction of the _other_ FAs that the patients could consume. From the informed layperson's perspective, this seems mistaken. If lots of n-6 FAs are consumed along with the EPA, then the ratio of ""bad"" prostanoid products to ""good"" prostanoid products could still be fairly ""bad."" Isn't this ratio the issue? What's the view of the gastro. community on EPA these days? EPA supplements, along with a fairly severe restriction of other FAs appear to have helped me significantly (though it could just be the low absolute amount of fat I eat -- 8-10% calories). -Brian <bmdelane@midway.uchicago.edu>"	other

However it is also widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity. And in ordinary life, perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is indicative of a psychological disorder.  In the extreme case, a perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might make that he is unable to even leave the house. In science, we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these discoveries.  Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata --- the search for scope and the search for certainty. If 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and Leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neither of the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, since they lacked the concept of a limit.  And in fact, because of the lack of a rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus. It was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid grounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.  Nonetheless, what Newton and Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great deal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost through the mistakes they made.

These are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and sci.psychology.  According to these posters  ""If it's not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then it's not science."" Taken to the extreme, I believe that the attitude that empirical studies are everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification of science. For one thing, an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology results in a sort of scientific trade-unionism, where those outside the establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have no chance to obtain a hearing.  (I don't in the least believe that this is the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology.  Nonetheless, it is one of the results.)   And although institutional science has certainly produced many wonderful results, I think it is a foolish arrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment --- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever come with anything worthwhile. Furthermore, the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is one of the most significant errors in science:  choosing to investigate questions because they can be readily handled by the currently fashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutional or corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention to those questions which seem to have fundamental significance. For instance, certain questions cannot be easily investigated with statistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative. (One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many areas of psychology.  In my opinion, a perusal of many of the papers resulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions into a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin's assertion that current scientific methods ""avoid all known errors."") I think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental error in science.  (Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the others.)  And I think that scientific journals are full of all too many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are worthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place. -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects. lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet"	other

I must assume that my wife's answer is closer to the truth than I hoped it was. She believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of it and not quit when they shoud be sated.  To put it a different way, she believes that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict. (Eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get the idea! }  IF she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of the food, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!  Can MSG be considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habit forming) ? This brings up a side question of mine.   I have noticed that cats (my children's and my parent's) seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet food. The cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other brand.  I have wondered if this is not a case of preference, but, some sort of chemical training or addiction. My questions, for the net, are: Does the FDA regulate the contents of pet food?  Is it allowed for pet food to contain addictive or conditioning substances?  Is MSG put in pet food? ----------------------------------- I speak for myself and not Motorola ----------------------------------- -- Walter Lundby"	other

Box 922 Huntington, NY 11743-0922		 NEWSLETTER 516/421-3258                                          APRIL 1993                                          VOLUME IV   No. 8 NEXT MEETING The next meeting is WEDNESDAY APRIL 14 at 8 pm at the Knights of Columbus Emerald Manor, 517 Uniondale Avenue in Uniondale. Our guest speaker will be Dr. Lewis Teperman.  Dr. Teperman trained in Pittsburgh under Dr. Starzl and is now the Assistant Director of the Liver Transplant Program at New York University Medical Center.  Dr. Teperman will discuss current trends in transplantation and treatment and will answer questions.  He is a long time friend of TRIO, surgeon to many of our members, and always a gracious and delightful guest.   It is sure to be a very informative, interesting and engaging evening.  Our hospitality committee,  Bette and Vito Suglia and Jim Spence will be well prepared, and at last the weather should be cooperative. We hope to see a very large gathering to welcome Dr. Teperman.           WEDNESDAY    APRIL 14  K of C   UNIONDALE LAST MEETING It has been noted here before that the Long Island Chapter of TRIO has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather, being able to forecast rain, sleet and snow fully a month in advance. No TV weatherman can match us. This time we not only scored again, but we were also able to disable the Long Island Railroad, making travel REALLY difficult.  None the less, many braved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good conversation.  Our scheduled speaker, Mrs. Elizabeth Linnehan, a professional nutritionist, had a family emergency and was not able to attend.  She hope she will be with us in the fall to discuss diet and medications.  However,  Ms. Jennifer Friedman, an image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient was kind enough to step in on very short notice.  Ms. Friedman gave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup, (even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and to minimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine and drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank her for an entertaining evening. ANNUAL MEETING In addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman, the April meeting is also the Annual meeting of the Chapter.  This is the official notice of the meeting as required by our By-Laws. The main purpose of the meeting is to review the past year, solicit member views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs, and to elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two year term.  The nominating committee has prepared the following slate for the Board.          Anne (Liver Recipient) and Don Treffeisen          Robert (Heart Recipient) and Eulene Smith          Vito (Kidney Recipient) and Bette Suglia          Kay Grenzig (Liver Recipient)          Jan Schichtel (Kidney Recipient)          Larry Juliano (Kidney Recipient)          David Bekofsky (Director Public Education LITP) Those remaining on the Board for another year are:          Robert Carroll (Liver, Kidney & Pancreas Recipient)          Jerry (Kidney Recipient) and Jeanne Eichhorn          Ron (Kidney Donor) and Marie Healy          Peter Smith (Bone Marrow Recipient)          Patricia Ann Yankus (Kidney and Pancreas Recipient)          Walter Ruzak (Kidney Recipient) This may seem to be a big Board, but many hands make light work and with our various medical uncertainties, it is good to have backups for all the jobs on the Board.  Therefore, in addition to the slate being presented for voting, nominations will also be accepted from the floor.  There is no set number of Board members and there is plenty of work. In addition,  brief treasurer's and membership reports will be given and the floor will be open for any new business, suggestions, or comments anyone would like to bring up. We will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the majority of the time with Dr. Teperman. FUTURE MEETINGS Remember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year.      May  12      Dr. Peter Shaprio, Chief of Psychiatry                   Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center      June  9      Dr. Felix Rappaport, Director of the Stony                   Brook Kidney Transplant Program. Plan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month. NOTDAW The week of April 18-24 is National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week. NOTDAW. While we are planning news releases, speaking engagements and meetings with Supervisors Gullata and Gaffney, we have decided not to have our softball game because of two year's experience with miserable weather. We all can help spread the word on donor awareness, however. We have found it effective to ask your pastor, or rabbi to publish a letter or announcement in the parish bulletin, allow you to address the congregation, or include mention of the gift of life in his sermon.  Attached to this Newsletter is a sample letter and fact sheet you can use.   Thank you. DR. STARZL TO BE HONORED The Long Island Chapter of the American Liver Foundation will hold its annual Auction and Dinner Dance on May 7th at the Fountainbleu  on Jericho Turnpike in Jericho.  Dr. Thomas Starzl will be the honored guest.  Tickets are $50 person and are going fast.  If you'd like to meet Dr. Starzl,  call Anne Treffeisen at (516) 421-3258 for details. MEMBERSHIP NEWS Congratulations to Al Reese.  Al received his heart transplant in Pittsburgh after waiting 3 1/2 years.  He is home and doing well after only 12 days in hospital. Arthur Michaels, liver recipient, is planning to run the Boston Marathon in April. What fantastic proof that transplantation works!  We hope the national press notices. Bob McCormack, after a persistent bout with infection, had his transplanted kidney removed.  He is home now, back on dialysis and feeling better. Nicole Healy, kidney recipient and daughter of Ron and Marie, spent the past several weeks in hospital in Miami with problems encountered on vacation.  Marie has been with her in Florida. They are back in New York where Nicole's treatment will continue.  We wish Nicole a speedy recovery. Kay Grenzig, liver recipient, is mending now after a bad fall that resulted in a broken arm and a broken leg. Kay is a candidate for the Board so we need her well soon. And best wishes to all coming out of the flu. It was a tough winter for many, but the tulips are just under the snow. SEE YOU......WEDNESDAY   APRIL 14  8 PM   K of C UNIONDALE                    DR.

The air flow of small 3.5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50% by using a 1 to 4 uF capacitor.  Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working voltage rating around 250 volts.  Note that some impriical study is usually required to experimentally determine the best size capacitor for a given application. For DC powered applications, try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan.

Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however, that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding. If you experience the problem frequently, it may be caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire, etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter. If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them). Good instructions are included with the chokes. If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things a radio operator can do to reduce interference. -- =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= Randall Rhea                                        Informix Software, Inc.

WHAT??!!!! You can't remove it, unless you register? You gotta be joking, right? What happens if I get a demo-version of that program, install it, and then decide that I don't like it.  Do I have to register to be able to get rid of it?  (Hell, no, that is the last thing I would think of!) If that is what you mean, then you would better make pretty sure, that a statement to that effect is printed loud and clear on the package! A better way to implement the above mentioned scheme is (IMHO) to allow anyone to install the program, but if they register, they get some additional features enabled.  It could mean only one new .EXE file needed to be copied, to have got the full-version of the program. Of course anyone is _free_ to _delete_ or _remove_ that program at whatever time they like. Still, we face the trouble of 'moving' the new .EXE file around.  That could be solved by having the user registering him self, and get back a specially marked for him (or her) a new .exe file. As for some sort of limitations, here are some suggestions: Limit the size of data that the program can work with, Disable saving the data, Print it out with some defects in the output (but be sure to mark them as such) Let some pop-up screen appear for ca. 10 secs. when the program is started and/or exited etc.... but DON'T have it that you _must_ register to be able to remove it. -- einari@rhi.hi.is	other

They cost ~$1 at Radio Shack (much cheaper in quantity at quality places), and you will be able to find good info about simple circuits in a 555 oscialltor notebook (I think Forest Mims has one at Radio Shack). You'll have to toy with resistor/capacitor values OR you can use your head with a little math to get the right frequencies. Any engineer worth his salt, can make a 555 osciallator... It's in the book, and left up to you to see (I hate doing ASCII circuit graphics). The 555 can accurately go from a few Hz to about 500 KHz (I think). About the Tape Recorder gizmo, you could alter a stereo tape deck to use one channel as a DATA line (for flashing LED), and one as audio line (for voice or music). This would eliminate a lot of noise. The data line is probably most easily done by some kind of PLL or bandpass filter (using just an op-amp). The 565 chip is a good PLL, and not hard to work with. However if you nothing about how a PLL works, I suggest you don't try this. Op-Amp information can also be found in the Forest Mims Radio Shack info-booklets, and the popular 741 op-amp is a snap to work with. Setting frequency and bandpass filter values are not so easy, so I would suggest the 555 method firstmost... I have no idea what this is going into, so I am really generalizing... As for manufacturing techniques, if you're only goofing with it, I suggest you breadboard the thing... No need to solder. Wire-wrap would be the next, more permanent step. And lastly, soldering/PCB making. Hope that clears things...... -squish@endor.harvard.edu	other

They work best for close work( 1 mile and under). RF is used for much longer distances in two major modes. Transponder and phase measurment. Transponder requires you send a pulse to another station and it returns it to you and you measure the round trip time minus the receiver time. Phase measurements require two or more transmitting stations sending the same frequency signal multiplexed in time. A receiver can pick them up and measure the phase shift between signals. Maps can be drawn that plot the Lines of Position that correspond to a certain phase shift between two stations. John Eaton !hp-vcd!johne	other

When I asked, people said that the >interpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more >complicated. You are quite correct in your understanding.  The filtering is not interpolation, as that would distort the frequency content of the signal you are listening to.  Generally, these players run the samples thru an all-pass filter network.  I have done this for ECG waveforms from a person's heart, and the effect is rather spooky.  It actually reconstructs peaks that weren't there (correctly, too!) and fills in the gaps with the properly computed values, just as if there had been a real sample taken at that point.  I use a CPU to do all the math.  It takes a decent (but not unreasonable) amount of CPU time to do this.  You can keep up with things in realtime if you write efficient code. In case you care, the filtering method uses an FIR (finite impulse response) filter.  I'd guess that CD makers use the same kind of method.  Anybody out there know the real answer?  I'd say that they use a tapped delay line with resistor/op-amp weighting to accomplish the filtering.  This strikes me as the most cost effective method for volume production runs. >Anyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the ""effective"" >sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency >antialiasing filters.

So, assuming the quality of >all other components in a CD player remained the same, oversampling should >allow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-alias >filtering. Actually, I think the only reason they do this is so that they can say that they have a marketting gimic.  I would guess that it is acutally cheaper to filter an oversampled signal than not.  You can use sloppier components and give the filter a roll-off that isn't so sharp.   It's too bad that they charge more for something that (I think) is actually less costly to build. I seriously doubt that the filters cost the same but are better.  They are built to a price spec, and that spec says ""cheap as possible!"". >					---Joel Kolstad   -dave -- Dave McMahan                            mcmahan@netcom.com                                         37N 17.382    121W 59.190"	other

If I were to design a microprocessor-based odometer/speedometer program, it would have the following features ( just off the top of my head ):          * Debouncing/deglitching  ( Is this a real pulse, or just a glitch? )          * Smoothing:  The rate-of-change of speed cannot be too high:                                 This is a car, not an electron.          *  Top speed limit:  Anything above 200MPH is ridiculous: must be                                         electrical noise or contact bounce     As for getting in and presetting the pins:  if this is the circuit board out of a BMW dashboard, I seem to remember a single big chip with lotsa pins in the middle of the card.  Good luck getting at the counter :-).     I wouldn't expect a high input frequency to damage the meter:  remember, it's probably damped so it can't move too fast, and is probably protected.  After all, a car is an extremely hostile place for delicate electronics;  there used to be an app note in the National Semiconductor Linear Databook that went into this in good detail.                                - Jerry Kaidor ( tr2!jerry@dragoman.com, jkaidor@synoptics.com )                                   - Jerry Kaidor	other

Ideally, output should be the same, but... The output value was only about 10% of the previous one!    Why? What is the nature of this output value? What does the voltmeter actually measure? And what does it show?    Related question (less important to me):    What are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with analog ones?

The NEUTRAL (white) wire is a 'grounding conductor' for the plug, and is NOT safe to touch, while the GROUND (green) wire is a 'protective ground' and carries no current unless some kind of electrical fault has occurred.

Subject: Introduction/Disclaimers 	Although we've done a fair bit of wiring, we are not 	electricians, and we cannot be responsible for what you do.  If 	you're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don't 	do it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician, 	or your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke; 	mistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution. 	Furthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National 	Electrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC). 	To the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail 	with the electrical code, but we don't quote sections 	simply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we're wrong, 	we invite you to correct us, but please - quote references! 	The NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the 	force of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others, 	however, do not.  Check your with your local building 	department (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in 	Canada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also, 	your local electrical utility may also have special requirements 	for electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that 	we say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family 	residences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial 	establishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different 	rules. 	Also note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in 	some parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary 	of the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada. 	Lots of things are the same, including voltages, line 	frequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number 	of crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we've 	noted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC'' or 	``CEC''. 	Remember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often 	smart to go beyond their minimal requirements. Subject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy? 	The NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the 	National Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group. 	It's revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released. 	You can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly 	at 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There's the 	full text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There's an abridged 	edition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses. 	And there's the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized 	commentary'' on the code, as well as the full text.  That's the 	recommended version.  Unfortunately, there's no handbook for 	the abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive -- 	US$65 plus shipping and handling. Subject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy? 	The Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up 	of various government agencies, power utilities, insurance 	companies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations. 	The CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two 	or three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments, 	this standard and publishes a province-specific code book. 	Since each province publishes its own slightly modified 	standard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA 	standard itself.  In this FAQ, ""CEC"" really means the 	appropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is 	derived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th 	edition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th 	edition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an 	attempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail. 	The appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical 	inspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In 	Ontario, it's Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn't 	overly fat.  It's about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I 	hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the 	equivalent NEC publications. 	Don't bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout 	the province. Subject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers? 	In most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring. 	In some, they're not.  Check with your local electrical 	inspector.  Most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's 	homes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do 	wiring in ""commercial"" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes) 	are usually considered ""semi-commercial"" or ""commercial"".  However, 	many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial 	wiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can 	find one willing to supervise. 	If you do your own wiring, an important point: 	Do it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better 	job than an electrician will do.  After all, it's your own home, 	and it's you or your family that might get killed if you make 	a mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills 	and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job. 	In this FAQ we've consciously given a few recommendations that 	are in excess of code, because we feel that it's reasonable, 	and will impress the inspector. 	The inspector will know that you're an amateur.  You have to 	earn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your 	time doing as neat a job as possible.  Don't cut corners. 	Exceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely 	picky and fault you on the slightest transgressions. 	Don't try to hide anything from the inspector. 	Use the proper tools.  Ie: don't use a bread knife to strip 	wires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector 	won't like it, and the results won't be that safe.  And it 	takes longer.  And you're more likely to stick a hunk of 	12ga wire through your hand that way. 	Don't handle house wire when it's very cold (eg: below -10C 	or 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types 	become very brittle. Subject: What do I need in the way of tools? 	First, there's the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few 	screwdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you're 	lucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved 	devices) you need Robertson (""square recess"") screwdrivers 	(#1 and #2) instead of phillips. 	For drilling a few holes, a 3/4"" or 1"" spade bit and 1/4"" or 	3/8"" electric drill will do.  If you're doing a lot, or 	are working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2"" drill 	(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and 	3/4"" or 1"" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull 	you through, so they're much faster and less fatiguing, even 	in 90 year old hardwood timbers. 	Screw-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you 	install your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws 	work well). 	For stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or 	ordinary wire cutters.  Don't buy the $3 K-mart ""combo stripper, 	crimper and bottle opener"" types.  You should expect to pay 	$15 to $20 for a good ""plier-type"" pair.  It will have sized 	stripping holes, and won't nick or grab the wire - it should 	be easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the 	blade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There 	are fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren't 	necessary, and pros usually don't use them. 	A pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends 	in constricted places.  Don't use these for stripping wire. 	You will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts. 	You should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling 	inside boxes and closing loops, but it's better to form wire 	loops with a ""loop former hole"" on your wire stripper - more 	accurate. 	If you're using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for 	removing the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the 	end of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers, 	and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a 	""zipper"", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn't try to strip 	the sheath with a knife point, because it's too easy to 	slash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley 	utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades) 	can be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility 	that you'll gouge the conductors. 	For any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it's well 	worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18). 	Hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire 	or the insulation. 	Three-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired 	outlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more 	expensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple 	voltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated 	wire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost 	about US$ 10 at Radio Shack. 	You should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are 	dead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3) 	and work well.  If you get more serious, a ""audible alarm"" type is 	good for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I've been known 	to lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-) 	For running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape. 	Often, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or 	a length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented. 	Electrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent 	wiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for 	wrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap 	around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination 	screws - I don't do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to 	prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet 	that has no cover plate). Subject: What is UL listing? 	The UL stands for ""Underwriters Laboratory"".  It used to be 	an Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent 	and non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment 	for potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means 	that the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements 	for safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn't necessarily 	mean that the device actually does what it's supposed to, just 	that it probably won't kill you. 	The UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are 	permitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However, 	insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will 	limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to 	the failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in 	many situations the NEC will require that a wiring component 	used for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose. 	Indirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring 	must be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or 	occupancy permits issued. Subject: What is CSA approval? 	Every electrical device or component must be certified by the 	Canadian Standards Association before it can be sold in 	Canada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done 	with CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to 	the UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is 	required by law. 	Again, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved 	equipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the 	claim. 	In Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC 	(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to 	be more a liason group between the CSA and insurance 	companies. Subject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring? 	USA: The following three books were suggested by our readers 	    Residential Wiring 	    by Jeff Markell, 	    Craftsman Books, 	    Carlsbad CA for $18.25. ISBN 0-934041-19-9. 	    Practical Electrical Wiring 	    Residential, Farm and Industrial,  Based on the National 	    Electrical Code    ANSI/NFPA 70 	    Herbert P. Richter and W. Creighton Schwan 	    McGraw-Hill Book Co. 	    Wiring Simplified 	    H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan 	    Park Publishing Co. 	Try to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC 	revision.  Which is currently 1990. 	Canada: P.S. Knight authors and publishes a book called 	""Electrical Code Simplified"".  There appears to be a version 	published specific to each province, and is very tied into the 	appropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring, 	and is indispensible for Canadian DIY'ers.  It is better to get 	this book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer 	questions on the net ;-). 	It is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is 	available at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10. Subject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected? 	Most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and 	inspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more 	mundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not 	liking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections 	provides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors 	or subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose 	their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job. 	Most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your 	home, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a 	permit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about 	this. 	If fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at 	fault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage 	claims. 	In general, the process goes like this: 		- you apply to your local inspections office or building 		  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or 		  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is 		  a good time to ask questions on any things you're not 		  sure of.  If you're doing major work, they may impose 		  special conditions on you, require loading 		  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point 		  they will tell you which inspections you will need. 		- If you're installing a main panel, you will need to 		  have the panel and service connections inspected 		  before your power utility will provide a connection. 		  This is sometimes done by the local power authority 		  rather than the usual inspectors. 		- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before 		  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a 		  ""rough-in"" inspection. 		- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete, 		  you will need a ""final inspection"". Subject: My house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations. 	Do I have to upgrade? 	In general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings, 	though there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some 	cases).  However, any new work must be done according to the 	latest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major'' work, you 	may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all 	of your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector. Subject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240 	One thing where things might get a bit confusing is the 	different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of 	a circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V 	or another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same 	thing...  In North America the utility companies are required 	to supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house. 	This works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there 	are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it's not 	unreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped 	to 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially 	at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number 	of reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness, 	different people choose call them by slightly different numbers. 	This FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them ""110V"" and 	""220V"", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will 	be.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it. 	One thing that might make this a little more understandable 	is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V 	instead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device 	is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that 	low. 	208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between 	phases of a 3-phase ""Y"" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any 	hot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase ""Y"" 	circuit that's 277V from hot to neutral. 	In keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended 	to run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V... Subject: What does an electrical service look like? 	There are logically four wires involved with supplying the 	main panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility 	pole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere.  	The bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded  	into the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes  	to the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where 	the main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic 	action conductivity ""breaks"" (often between copper and iron pipe)). 	This is the ""grounding conductor"".  It is there to make sure that 	the third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire 	normally carries no current. 	One of the other wires will be white (or black with white or 	yellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire. 	It is connected to the ""centre tap"" (CEC; ""center tap"" in the 	NEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It 	is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often 	inside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected 	anywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen. 	Furthermore, there should only be one grounding system in 	a home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode. 	These will be connected together, or connected to the neutral 	at a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional 	grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house 	wiring is unsafe and contrary to code. 	If you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually 	brought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are 	not connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one 	neutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations 	(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do 	have to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your 	inspector. 	The other two wires will usually be black, and are the ""hot"" 	wires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as 	well. 	The two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each 	other.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires, 	the voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the 	white and either of the two blacks you will get 110V. 	Some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them. 	This is either because the neutral and ground are connected 	together at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one 	wire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some 	rare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only 	service). Subject: What is a circuit? 	Inside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires. 	These connections are then used to supply power to selected 	portions of the home.  There are three different combinations: 		1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit. 		2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit. 		3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral, 		   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral. 	(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and 	lighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying 	power to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they 	often have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several 	circuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is 	usually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or 	air conditioners. 	[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar 	to (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there 	are two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral 	and ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing 	the neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead 	of four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel. 	When connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles 	are required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but 	the NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC, 	and found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to 	local practice -- there are restrictions on when this is 	permissible.] 	(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot, 	white for neutral, and bare for grounding. 	(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a 	bare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral. 	You will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground 	wire.  Since the white is ""hot"" in this case, both the NEC and CEC 	requires that the white wire be ""permanently marked"" at the ends 	to indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail 	polish or sometimes electrical tape. 	Each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the 	panel through a circuit breaker or fuse. 	There are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2) 	or (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places 	require this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is ""frame ground"", 	the other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an 	alternative to GFCI protection. Subject: ""grounding"" versus ""grounded"" versus ""neutral"". 	According to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the 	""grounding"" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green 	or bare wire.  The word ""neutral"" is reserved for the white when 	you have a circuit with more than one ""hot"" wire.  Since the white 	wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the 	panel, the proper term is ""grounded conductor"".  However, the 	potential confusion between ""grounded conductor"" and ""grounding 	conductor"" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should 	never use the bare wire as a ""grounded conductor"" or white wire 	as the ""grounding conductor"", even though they are connected 	together in the panel. 	[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground 	separately from the main panel.  Usually.] 	In the trade, and in common usage, the word ""neutral"" is used 	for ""grounded conductor"".  This FAQ uses ""neutral"" simply to 	avoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use ""neutral"" 	too.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light 	switch applications) neutral.  Not ground. Subject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences? 	Fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power 	to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For 	example, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should 	""trip"", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As 	such, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the 	wiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the 	equipment itself won't cause a fire. 	Fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt 	(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby 	interrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively 	fast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have 	large startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use 	a ""time-delay"" fuse (one brand is ""fusetron"") which will avoid 	tripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a 	spring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be 	replaced. 	Breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They 	usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched 	into position against another contact.  When the current flow 	through the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip 	heats up and bends.  By bending it ""trips"" the latch, and the 	spring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave 	similarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to 	trip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high 	overloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite 	number of times - each time they trip, or are thrown 	when the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which 	damages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in 	place of switches unless they are specially listed for the 	purpose. 	Neither fuses nor breakers ""limit"" the current per se.  A dead 	short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even 	thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which 	can often cause severe damage. Subject: Breakers?  Can't I use fuses? 	Statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher 	risk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually 	due to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts 	corroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse 	being installed, or the proverbial ""replace the fuse with a 	penny"" trick. 	Since breakers are more permanently installed, and have better 	connection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less. 	Fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When 	a fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting 	path.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel, 	melted service wiring, through fires in the electrical 	distribution transformer and having your house burn down. 	Breakers don't do this. 	Many jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit 	fuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new 	fuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special 	inserts to ""key"" the fuseholder to specific size fuses) 	Some devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse 	protection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse 	is there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the 	labeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently 	installed motors.  The installation instructions will tell you 	if you need one. Subject: What size wire should I use? 	For a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit, 	you can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run, 	though, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid 	voltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than 	14 gauge, though it's stiffer and harder to work with. 	Here's a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for 	more than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or 	ganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate 	heat easily: 		Gauge		Amps 		14		15 		12		20 		10		30 		8		40 		6		65 	We don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent 	on the application and precise wire type. Subject: Where do these numbers come from? 	There are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup. 	The smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When 	the resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is 	more voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need 	higher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in 	conduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long 	runs. 	Neither effect is very significant over very short distances. 	There are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller 	wire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most 	lamps.  Don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits 	one of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger 	wire. Subject: What does ""14-2"" mean? 	This is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors 	in a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second 	the number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but 	remember there's usually an extra ground wire.  ""14-2"" means 	14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground. 	-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes 	the white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In 	the latter case, the sheath is usually red too. 	-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire. 	Usually carrying 220V with neutral. Subject: What is a ""wirenut""/""marrette""/""marr connector""?  How are they 	used? 	A wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used 	to connect wires together.  ""Marrette"" or ""Marr connector"" 	are trade names.  You'll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring. 	In essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them 	together, then twist the wirenut on. 	Though some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the 	wire, do it anyways - it's more mechanically and electrically 	secure. 	There are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check 	that the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the 	quantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together. 	Don't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or 	your fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose (""linesman"") pliers, 	and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes 	it's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it 	goes in the wirenut properly. 	Some people wrap the ""open"" end of the wirenut with electrical 	tape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may 	tear it off during an inspection.  It's usually done because 	a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead 	of taping it, the connection should be redone. Subject: What is a GFI/GFCI? 	A GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter''.  It measures 	the current current flowing through the hot wire and the 	neutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the 	presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other 	path.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of 	an appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any 	of these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking 	the circuit. 	GFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If, 	for example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral 	leads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI 	wouldn't help.  All of the current that passed from the hot 	lead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the 	GFCI happy. 	The two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric. 	One is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed 	*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be 	protected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices 	downstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be 	covered by a single GFCI outlet. Subject: Where should GFCIs be used? 	The NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase 	outlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of the sink, garages, 	unfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or 	just about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water 	or dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets, 	those dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space'', 	typically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and 	laundry appliances. 	The CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there 	is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or 	basement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you 	have a dirt floor, garage outlets if they're near the door to 	outside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs. 	Even if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may 	want to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI 	breaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI 	outlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in 	Canada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your 	finished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children? 	Do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does 	water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage? Subject: Where shouldn't I use a GFCI? 	GFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don't pose a 	safety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run 	unattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers, 	and sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs 	are sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that 	the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary 	current imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most 	GFCI trips are real; if you're getting a lot of trips for no 	apparent reason, you'd be well-advised to check your wiring 	before deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless. Subject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker? 	For most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the 	first device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with 	a built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI 	breakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE 	breaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one 	major exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch 	circuit'' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire), 	such as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you'll need a 	multi-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive; 	the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on 	what brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such 	a circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice. 	One more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use 	an oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use 	large (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You'll thank yourself for it. 	Incidentally, if you're installing a GFCI to ensure that one 	specific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don't 	really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first 	outlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet 	in the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But 	protecting the whole circuit is preferred. 	When you install a GFCI, it's a good idea to use the little 	""ground fault protected"" stickers that come with it and mark 	the outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which 	outlets are ""downstream"", simply by tripping the GFCI with the 	test button and see which outlets are dead. Subject: What's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then? 	Apart from their use in electronics, which we won't comment on, 	and for certain fluorescent lights (they won't turn on without 	a good ground connection), they're intended to guard against 	insulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of 	the appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there's an 	insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the 	ground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly 	trips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not 	grounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if 	you touch it while you're grounded, you'll get zapped.  Of 	course, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very 	tiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace 	ungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC). 	There are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In 	particular, that applies to toasters and anything else with 	exposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating 	electrode in a toaster, and you're not grounded, nothing will 	happen.  If you're slightly grounded, you'll get a small shock; 	the resistance will be too high.  But if the case were 	grounded, and you were holding it, you'd be the perfect path to 	ground... Subject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization 	Nowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the 	other.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!) 	on one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot. 	This is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the 	the shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to 	have an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios). 	Most 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too. 	This requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right 	way around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the 	narrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the 	hot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral. 	If not, you can usually figure out which is which by which 	prong the terminating screw connects to. Subject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen? 	The NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance 	circuits'' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex 	receptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more 	than 24"" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider 	than 12"" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet. 	The circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except 	in the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits 	are in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves, 	lighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6' of a sink *must* be 	protected by a GFCI (NEC only). 	Split duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab 	is broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to 	the upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet. 	The neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When 	""carrying through"" to another outlet, the neutral must be 	pigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral 	connection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect 	from downstream outlets. Subject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms? 	There must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to 	the sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in 	the light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected. Subject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each? 	Romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire. 	Sometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM. 	This is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside 	stud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject 	to mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are 	wired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several 	different categories of NM cable. 	BX cable -- technically known as armored cable or ""AC"" has a 	flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is 	fairly resistant to damage. 	TECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic 	sheath. 	Protection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable 	is run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer 	surface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25"" (CEC & NEC) 	from the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected 	from mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of 	metal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit. 	[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored 	cable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection, 	but this is technically illegal.] 	Additional protection recommendations (these are rules in the 	Canadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague 	references to ""exposed to mechanical damage"" in both the NEC 	and CEC): 	    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage 	      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls 	      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor. 	      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc. 	    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces 	      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian 	      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet 	      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable 	      or NM cable in flexible conduit to ""jump"" to the appliance. 	      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used. 	    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating 	      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by 	      means of a 25mm/1"" air space, or suitable insulation 	      material (a wad of fiberglass). 	    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1' of every box 	      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5'. 	      Holes in joists or studs are considered ""supports"". 	      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to 	      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation, 	      it is permitted where ""proper"" support is impractical] 	    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge. 	      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring 	      to the ""workmanship"" clause, but this seems more honoured 	      in the breach...] 	    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or 	      similar finish. 	    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards. 	    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists 	      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more 	      than 1m (39""). 	Whenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small 	plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to 	prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through 	the insulation. 	BX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by 	solid wall coverings. 	In places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of 	a garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a 	UL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of 	fittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the 	wire. 	Service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit. 	In damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will 	need special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like 	very heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of 	conduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground 	wiring section.]  	Thermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be  	exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that  	purpose. 	Many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through 	furnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed 	by metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this 	is that if there's a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses 	from burning insulation very rapidly through the building. 	Teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas.  	Canada appears to use similar wire designations to the US,  	except that Canadian wire designations usually include the  	temperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: ""AC90"" versus ""AC"". 	In the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius. 	NOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes 	most often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*. 	There are very different requirements for mobile homes. 	Check your local codes, *especially* if you're doing anything 	that's the slightest out of the ordinary.

The NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable 	only.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box 	itself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic 	boxes don't use metal cable clamps. 	The CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable 	armor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still 	provide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also 	requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes. 	The advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for 	non-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground 	connection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other 	hand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For 	exposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better. Subject: Junction box positioning? 	A junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together. 	Junction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible 	later.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction 	boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may 	get nasty. Subject: Can I install a replacement light fixture? 	In general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few 	caveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage 	rating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half 	a dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire 	back to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle 	constraints as well.  For example, older house 	wiring doesn't have high-temperature insulation.  The excess 	heat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the 	insulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results. 	Some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high 	temperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your 	ceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case 	replacing any devices is a real adventure.) 	Other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some 	fluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and 	its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy 	chandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box 	specifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling 	joists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available 	that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and 	mounted between the joists. 	There are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as 	""pot"" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated 	ceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard. 	The CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated 	ceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a ""coffin"" (usually 	8'x16""x12"" - made by making a pair of joists 12"" high, and covering 	with plywood) that doesn't have any insulation.  (Yes, that's 8 *feet* 	long) 	NEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3"" 	clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation. 	The rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement, 	which means that a CEC-style ``coffin'' might be worthwhile. 	Presumably, that's up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn't 	actually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector 	requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get 	accidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown 	in later.] 	There are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and 	fairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are 	usually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat 	more expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should 	ensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses. 	Follow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location 	for the sensor can vary. 	There does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved 	for use in insulation.  The ""coffin"" appears the only legal approach. Subject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts? 	This usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is 	loose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up 	being more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with 	respect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can 	destroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in 	some situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions 	require the stove frame connected to neutral). 	If this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately 	and have them come and check out the problem. 	Note: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with 	lighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A 	loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness 	far longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help. Subject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house? 	Three phase power has three ""hot"" wires, 120 degrees out of 	phase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors 	because it is more ""efficient"", provides a bit more starting torque, 	and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper. 	You're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows 	110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between 	any two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal 	220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the 	two hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages. 	Bringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually 	ridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you 	want to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to 	buy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is 	possible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have 	a ""capacitor start"" unit, or use a larger motor as a 	(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if 	the motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to 	replace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop'' has an 	article on how to do this if you must. 	Note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using 	such a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that. Subject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220? 	Theoretically, it doesn't make any difference.  However, there 	is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply 	wiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times 	less power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also 	means that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor 	will get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the 	smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life. 	This is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more 	than 50 feet long. Subject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits? 	It is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746 	watts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies, 	it is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200 	watts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor, 	so it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational 	efficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it. 	Some equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router 	manufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far 	in excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a ""stall 	horsepower"" or similar.  That means the power is measured when 	the motor is just about to stop turning because of the load. 	What they don't mention is that if you kept it in that 	condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker 	will trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it's drawing far 	more current than it can continuously. 	When comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This 	should be on the motor nameplate.  If you can't find that figure, 	check the amperage rating, which is always present. Subject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong? 	Older homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead 	of the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety 	ground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither 	the NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore. 	There are several different approaches to solving this: 	    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the 	       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect 	       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle 	       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise. 	    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and 	       it's continuous to the main house ground point, you can 	       run a conductor to it from the third prong. 	    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel. 	    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug 	       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI 	       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI 	       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong 	       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets, 	       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it 	       wouldn't be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault 	       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected 	       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren't 	       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath 	       on BX cable. 	The CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three 	prong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop. 	Like caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC. Subject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets? 	Should the test button work? 	We're sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though, 	that your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there's 	a resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE 	side of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current 	through this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI. 	This is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn't require 	a real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press 	the TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again: 	if the test button doesn't work, something's broken, and potentially 	dangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately. 	The instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground 	wire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The 	causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the 	formalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never 	tested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand, 	UL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device 	behaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded 	outlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are 	labeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician 	was surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require 	it, and promised to investigate.) Subject: How should I wire my shop? 	As with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all 	devices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies 	that you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the 	circuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for 	the major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or 	shop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have 	big motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp 	breakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles 	which means you'd have to ""replug"" all your equipment.  Lights 	should either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared 	with circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two 	separate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a 	situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand 	RPM, while you're groping in the dark for the OFF switch. 	Do install lots of outlets.  It's easier to install them in the 	beginning, when you don't have to cut into an existing cable. 	It's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each 	point, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same 	time as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and 	plates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have 	objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit 	wrong. 	Note that some jurisdictions have a ""no horizontal wiring"" 	rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used 	for working.  What this means is that all wiring must be 	run along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs. 	Other possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V 	circuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits. 	Don't overload circuits, and don't use extension cords if you 	can help it, unless they're rated for high currents.  (A coiled 	extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of 	the same gauge.  Also, the insulation won't withstand as much 	heat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.) 	If your shop is located at some remove from your main panel, 	you should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop 	wiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to 	equip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock. 	If you want to install individual switches to ``safe'' 	particular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough. 	For example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to 	handle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy 	``horsepower-rated'' switches instead. 	Finally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished 	basements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And 	even if you ``know'' that you'd never use one of your shop 	outlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might 	have a different idea. 	Note: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop 	wiring.  April 1992 is one place to start. Subject: Underground Wiring 	You will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use 	special wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic 	tubing and possibly lumber (don't use creosoted lumber, it rots 	thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion 	of lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is 	generally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically 	listed for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets, 	fittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion 	in water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And 	of course, don't forget the GFCIs. 	The required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to 	jurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about 	your specific situation. 	A hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says ""buried power 	line"" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed. Subject: Aluminum wiring 	During the 1970's, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became 	quite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time, 	aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires, 	and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations. 	We recommend, even if you're allowed to, that do not use it for new 	wiring. 	But don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum 	wiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper. 	Aluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper 	installation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential 	problems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe. 	The main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as 	""cold creep"".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When 	it cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes 	through a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each 	time.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes 	when in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance 	of the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/ 	oxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot, 	melt the insulation or fixture it's attached to, and possibly even 	cause a fire. 	Since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move 	into a house built during the 70's, we will cover basic points of 	safe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you're considering purchasing 	a home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you 	hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring 	for the following things: 	    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to 	       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will 	       be stamped with ""Al/Cu"" or ""CO/ALR"".  The latter supersedes 	       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat 	       more expensive than the ordinary ones. 	    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around 	       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be 	       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the 	       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug 	       up each connection. 	       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the 	       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected. 	    3) ""push-in"" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire. 	       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with 	       the proper screw connections immediately. 	    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections, 	       melted insulation, or ""baked"" fixtures.  Any such damage should 	       be repaired. 	    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be 	       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the 	       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting 	       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be 	       connected together using special crimp devices, with an 	       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter 	       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless 	       you can rent the tool. 	    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring 	       by means of a short copper ""pigtail"".  See (5) above. 	    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped 	       (not nicked) wire etc. 	If, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring 	shows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider 	the wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places, 	we suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used, 	you can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having 	this professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch. 	You can do this yourself too. Subject: I'm buying a house!  What should I do? 	Congratulations.  But...  It's generally a good idea to hire 	an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas. 	Not just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an 	inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor 	ones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any 	minor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many 	places, we suggest you look elsewhere. 	Here's some hints on what to look for: 	Obvious non-code wiring can include: 		- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls 		- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without 		  proper marking. 		- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of 		  a GFCI) 		- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube) 		- Switched neutrals 		- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines 	Certain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one 	time) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations: 		- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps 		   not properly terminated wiring) 		- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are 		  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when 		  it's *really* convenient ;-) 		- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations 		- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps 		- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them 		- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or 		  ceiling 		- Backwrapped grounding wires Subject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring 	In the years since Edison ""invented"" electricity, several different 	wiring ""styles"" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you 	may encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old 	methods, and some of their idiosyncrasies. 	The oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called 	""knob and tube"" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with 	a cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural 	members (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs). 	Wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections 	were made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping 	with tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately, 	the wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs 	down the centre of each room, with ""taps"" off to each fixture. 	The hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some 	cases K&T isn't colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same 	colour as the hot wires. 	You'll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40's. 	Comments on K&T: 		- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about 		  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good. 		- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up 		  very well.  Most K&T I've seen, for example, is in 		  quite good condition. 		- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install. 		- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with 		  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either, 		  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry. 		- Sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between 		  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to 		  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on 		  any circuit. 		- Building code does not permit insulation in walls 		  that contain K&T. 		- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be 		  tricky.  Consult your inspector. 		- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more 		  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did. 	Since K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't 	necessary to replace it simply because it's K&T.  What you should 	watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and 	be cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it's perfectly 	reasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on 	new circuits using modern techniques. 	After K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type 	you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks 	much like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was 	used in the 40's and 50's.  Again, no grounding conductor. 	It was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback 	is that this type of insulation embrittles.  We've seen whole 	systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at 	a touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems. 	This stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if 	the wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as 	much as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it. 	A simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several 	hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink 	tubing. 	After this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented. 	It's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky. 	This stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard 	and is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be 	replaced - it should be considered as safe as the ""modern"" stuff - 	thermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don't abuse it too much. Subject: Where do I buy stuff? 	Try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Their 	prices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or 	DIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety 	including the ""odd"" stuff, and have people behind the counter that 	know what you're talking about.  Cultivate friendly knowledgeable 	sales people.  They'll give you much valuable information. -- Chris Lewis; clewis@ferret.ocunix.on.ca; Phone: Canada 613 832-0541 Psroff 3.0 info: psroff-request@ferret.ocunix.on.ca Ferret list: ferret-request@ferret.ocunix.on.ca"	other

This is, of course, assuming that the program uses something in ROM (like the BIOS serial number, maybe?) and not a disk-based code number. Obviously if the drive goes bad you'll be reinstalling the stuff anyway. I work in a computer lab which is part of the university microlab system. We have the wonderfully fun task of maintaining well over a hundred machines, both PC and Macintosh, as well as administering a network of over 50 NeXT machines.  I personally am concerned only with a small lab with ten PC's and ten Mac's.  (I'm not the manager, but help him with admin often).  IMHO, copy-protection schemes of ANY sort are nothing more than a major headache for the legitimate user.  Anyone who wants a copy of your program and doesn't care about legality will get a copy.  Period. ""Pirate board"" or no pirate board.  I too have ""friends"" who blatantly and quite successfuly ""hack"" copy protection schemes practically in their sleep. Let's consider what goes on in our lab.  Almost daily we have at least one machine down, sometimes several, due to some goofball screwing up some setting or other on a piece of software.  Admittedly, we (being students, mostly) are not the world's most efficient and effective network administrators, but we try.  Keeping even the twenty machines that are (partly) my responsibility even vaguely looking and ""acting"" similar to the average user, and maintaining ""behind-the-scenes"" consistency is a real headache, but not so bad a headache as trying to remember twenty different folder locations of Norton Utilities when some guy trashes his disk. Often we have hardware problems at peak ""business"" times and have to do some parts-swapping to get stuff working temporarily. . . . Well, I'll cut to the chase and quit boring y'all . . .. The point is, often we have to re-install software and copy configuration files etc. from machine to machine.  By far the easiest way we have found to do this is to get ONE machine working EXACTLY the way we want to, then COPY the complete setup of this machine to the other nine (of that machine's type).  This ensures us that (for at least ten minutes) we have ten IDENTICAL machines to work with.  Having them networked simplifies this considerably, as our major packages (WordPerfect, Windows, etc.) are all network versions and thus only one copy to mess with. Often, however, we need to install a package requested by some instructor to one, some, or all of the machines for a special project.  This is usually a hand-written or shareware,etc. program similar to what I believe the original poster was asking about.  The few we have had with ""copy protection"" schemes have caused nothing but NIGHTMARES for us to maintain  . . In short, don't waste your time with a copy protection scheme.  It's sort of like outlawing guns.  The criminals will get your program anyway, and you will only be hurting the legitimate, honest user.  Write a good user's guide and tech manual, whatever else for your program (PLEASE do this REGARDLESS of whether you copy protect the thing!!!), and only distribute the manual to LICENSED users.  Jack the price to cut your losses, but please take a cue from the major companies (who can admittedly afford the costs of illegal copies far better than you) and don't burden the legitimate user with a ""copy protection"" scheme!

The best info I have seen so far is the article ""Joystick Metrics: Measuring physical properties through the PC's joystick port"" by Michael Covington in the May 1985 issue of PC Tech Journal.  It talks about how to read all kinds of things (voltage, current, resistance) in BASIC, and even includes code for a simple ""oscilloscope"" display. It's possible to read the joystick port directly if you don't want to use BASIC.  The detailed information for this is in the PC Technical Reference under Options and Adapters.  You have to provide some millisecond resolution timing functions, but that's a subject which has appeared many times in articles from Dr. Dobb's, Circuit Cellar Ink, etc.  Look for the public domain ztimer package on wuarchive.

Information of how to build an EEPROM cartidge for the vectrex is available via anonymous ftp at 'csus.edu'. Since you've chosen the 27C512 you are probably trying to make a 'multicart'. To do this simply: 1. Load the game images into the EEPROM at $2000, $4000, etc. (Your EEPROM burner software may allow this or you will have to assemble the images into one file yourself with suitable gaps.) 2. Wire up the cartridge with the lower address bits going to the game console, and the high bits going to switches to choose between games. To directly answer your question above, the pin that 'kicks up the address' is simply another address line. For a concrete example, with the 27C512 and 8K games images, you would wire A0-A12 to the cartridge, and A13-A15 to 3 switches.  The 3 switches would allow you to pick from the 8 games on the EEPROM.	other

Not all > of us have about 200 floppies around for backup, you know. 	Actually, no I don't have a tape drive.  In the event of a total hard disk failure, I reinstall the apps from originals, and restore the data from the backups I keep of that.  With upwards of 100Mb of stuff on my hard disk, there is no way I'm going to try and back it all up without a tape drive. :)  Would be nice to have one though! > RAM is something you add all the time, so no.  It's more like BIOS > manufacturer and/or processor type (386/486/etc).  Data cannot be used, > esp with these new Flash ROM BIOS machines with updates on a diskette. 	Maybe, maybe not.  Today it doesn't happen as often (I would hope), but then if a BIOS is buggy and the user gets an upgrade, the BIOS information is going to change, at least the date anyway.  Tagging the BIOS manufacturer is still going to falsely tag those users who upgrade the motherboard.  This type of upgrade doesn't require a hard disk backup/restore. > On the other hand, to make this LESS intrusive it could be disguised as > ""Please Insert Original Disk #XX as I need file YYYYYY for update"".  :-) > It would be perfectly reasonable...

Your scheme isn't going to stop anyone. > Of course it is easier.  Are you saying then the originals SHOULD allow > only one install?  What is your point? 	Of course not.  If something gets corrupted and my app needs to be reinstalled, the *worst* thing I want that software telling me is ""this software has already been registered to <blank> and it is against the law to install it on other machines.""  Or something similar; Access for Windows does this and it only requires a click on ""OK"" to go away.  Pretty non-intrusive, but it gets the point across. > What I said was the program should have certain restriction (such as the > restrict-to-one-machine) UNTIL the program is registered with the > manufacturer.

This is a great idea.  I like the key system that some shareware products use.  The only problem is that it will be difficult for big software companies to implement this without it getting very cost-ineffective for them and more of a burden than a benefit to the users. -- Steve Madsen sjmadsen@nextsrv.cas.muohio.edu Ask me about Linux, the free 386 unix!"	other

You order distinctive ringing from your phone company.  This is $3/month here. You get a second (unpublished) phone number.  When someone calls this number, your phone rings with short rings instead of long rings. You set up your answering machine on 4 rings and your fax on six rings.  You'd give out the new # as your fax #. A device would measure the length of rings.  When it detects a short ring, it turns off your answering machine. Five rings later your fax picks up the call. This should be cheaper and more elegant than the $80 switches now available. But that's not what I did.  I'm giving out the new # to my friends and customers.  This should leave the old # for telemarketers, etc.  I won't pick up the phone when I hear the long rings. -- ""Why my thoughts are my own, when they are in, but when they are out they are another's."" - Susannah Martin, hanged for witchcraft, 1692.

Which Sony do you have??  I have a 27""SXR (pre-XBR series, circa 1987).  That damn thing used to make noise like a mad-man.  I had/have 2 separate problems...one being the flyback, the other was the assembly where the windings of the yoke came together. First:  I found by poking around the windings on that assembly, the thing would make noise.  I guess that there was enough of a potential in that assembly to leak, so I sprayed it with a dielectric insulation spray--I think it was urethane or acyrilic.  That fixed it. Second:  Flyback...for the life of me, I can't isolate this one.  If I leave the cover off, the TV will be quiet.  If I put the cover back on, and let it heat up, it'll start to whine--kinda hard to solve with the cover on!! :-( A friend of mine who used to fix TV's says there might be a pin-hole leak somewhere on the flyback.  Usually it's surrounded by a bunch of black dust/dirt. I hope this is a start...if you find something out, let me know! aaron"	other

Thanks.    A program in the archive keymap00.zip on simtel and mirror sites in the msdos/keyboard directory will do this.  It is written in assembler and it best if you have a compiler to create a new keyboard map.  It is possible, however, to use a binary editor to edit the provided compiled keyboard driver if you do not have a compiler.  I used hexed100.zip, also available on simtel.  Simply serach for the codes 00 01 02 03 to locate the biginning of the ""normal"" keyboard map.  Then swap the codes for the keys that you wish to swap.  See the keyboard directory of simtel for programs that report the scancode for each key to you (some bios programs also have this info).

Keywords: HD, controller, IDE, ESDI, disks Sender: news@IRO.UMontreal.CA Organization: Universite de Montreal Date: Sat, 17 Apr 1993 17:14:55 GMT Lines: 57 Hello all, You, the Net, are my last resort, or I'll just change my job :-) This might be a FAQ (e.g. mixing controllers) but haven't seen any. Sys: 486/33, AMI BIOS, and your run-of-the mill multi-I/O card with serials/paral/floppies and 	- IDE controller ""clone"" Gw2760-EX 		there are no jumpers affecting the HD or ctrller :-( 	- Quantum ProDrive LPS (3"" 105M type 47: 755cyl, 16hds, 17spt). Pb: I want to bring in this (2nd hand, neat price): 	- Maxtor XT-B380E (~330M, <15ms, BIOS type 1, ctrller manages 		the real geom: 1630cyl, 8hds, 52spt) 	- Western Digital WD1007V-SE1 ESDI ctrller: no floppies. 		(jumpers set IRQ 14/15, hw port addr 1F0/170, 		and BIOS addr CC00/C800, and other floppy/format stuff) Goal: have the WD ESDI as a secondary/controller and have both disks simultaneously working. Being able to boot from the ESDI too would be a nice bonus but is not expected. Ultimate goal: have room for Linux et al. Ex of scheme I have in mind: boot from IDE (HD or floppy) and mount the ESDI as root. Not booting from ESDI, or even from HD, is acceptable. I have tried numerous (all!!) combinations to no avail. They work alone, or can coexist witout hang-ups but can't access the ESDI or the IDE, depending on setup/jumpers. Useful suggestions might be: - How do I tell the BIOS setup about two ctrllers (I guess the 2nd HD is expected to hang off the same ctrller as the 1st). - Do I need some driver to make it work? - --- "" --- some new BIOS/chip for any of these cards? - do I have to buy another controller to make them HDs happy? IDE is cheaper; ESDI is hard to find and rather costly. I'm not rich or I wouldnt' try to scavenge around, so soft slns are preferred. - adapters of some sort; I can hold a soldering iron, and can change a chip or put a jumper! Also useful: - BBS or Hot-line of Western Digital. - ftp archives with relevant info. - expert stores in Toronto, Ontario area (that would be a miracle! haven't seen any really knowledgeable ppl in a while) - any hints into inner workings of the system ... - anything else that helped you in similar situations (prayers :-) ) Direct or posted replies are ok.

Ideally, I'd like to get a new multi I/O card, that had 2 serial ports with 16550's and could also control another 2 IDE HD's. It would have to have configurable addresses for both the serial ports, and the IDE controller, so it could co-exist with my existing card. Does such a beast exist?

There are five inputs signals: RD, DSR, DCD, CTS, and RI. There are many differnt null modem requiremts as dictated by the software. The IBM BIOS requires asserts DTR and RTS and then waits for both DSR and CTS before sending.  When a BIOS recieve call is made, it asserts DTR and waits for DSR to become true (times out after a while and returns with an error if DSR never becomes true).  It requires CTS to be true for sending AND recieving.  Most communications packages bypass this and replace it with their own protocol.  The key is that each comm. package could very well have different requirements. My favorite cable works in many cases: short RTS to CTS at each end, but also run RTS through to DCD at the opposite end.  TD runs through to RD and DTR runs through to DSR from both DTE's and of course SG goes through to SG. I have never had trouble with this null modem even though I have used it with a comm. package that was expecting RTS to go to CTS instead of DCD. The advantage of this cable is that it also works with the IBM BIOS. Gordon Lang	other

The first of which is a CMF voice editor which is hopefully going to be available soon (as soon as I can get it to an FTP site). Anyway the next stage is to use the midi port to enter music and play the FM synth remotely. The problem is that I have little or no info on the SB midi port. I have tried using the Sound blaster freedom project routines, however this just results in the port locking after a couple of accesses and loss the of note velocity data byte. I am using Turbo C and would be grateful for any info or source fragments may help. When I was in Berlin this summer I saw a book which seemed to have all this information, but my German is poor to say the least, if anyone has this book could they please mail me. My second request for help concerns standard file formats (how can a file format be standard if you keep it secret ?) I need to know the file format for instrument bank files *.BNK and Roland music files *.ROL. Finally does anyone have a source for displaying PCX or GIF files to EGA or VGA monitors.

At begining of the test, the harddisk will be checked at the speed that usually is.  As the surface test scaned half way through my harddisk, a tremendous slow down occured.  The expected time for operation will jump from 3 to 6 minutes.  I try to use some of the harddisk tools to check if there is any physical damage to my harddisk and report always turn out to be none.  The surface test only slow down for a certain section of the disk and turn back to the original speed after it gets over the section.  I am wondering whether it is a harddisk problem or some other problems. Anyway help or comment will be appriciate....                                                  Shane Cheney Wang	other

I've been offered the following CD-ROM players, for the prices stated. They all claim to have SCSI-I, and operate under OS/2. The drives are not listed in the cdrom-faq and therefor, please give your opinions on the drives, i've got the impression that they're not all SCSI. Actually the Nec was listed as non-scsi in the cdrom-faq and as a compatible SCSI product in the os2faq. I've calculated the prices as having dutch guilders times 2. It's actually about times 1.8.

Husak - husak@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu - Univerisity of Illinois Does it do it to all tapes?  Were the two tapes that it unwound of the same type from the same batch?  The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and had closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set. Did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels? If you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base. As you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more than you have to.  As you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in the tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is at the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second marker? Anyhow, If the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tape is clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where the reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by, the pickup detects the light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty or out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have a problem detecting the end of the tape. If the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then either the pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head assembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive may need to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor is out. If it is still in warranty, you might be able to send it back to CMS for repair. --- Scott Hiles whiles@relay.nswc.navy.mil Standard disclaimer:   The opinions expressed are those of my own and do not necessarily   reflect those of the DOD or the Navy.

If IDE speed come from IDA WHERE does the 8.3MB/s sighted for IDE come from? SCSI is not complex. It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it. There are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip, the port, and the software.  THAT IS IT. Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point. SCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY}  asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s}  synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a  rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.} SCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from  SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs  this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers  AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the  slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode  4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous  mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s} SCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things  over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the  machine and the external device.  Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver  software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2.  Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst. SCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this  requires: SCSI-2 driver software, wide SCSI-2 port, and that the RECIEVING  devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.  As expected this is VERY  expencive.  Speed: 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s bursts As I said SIMPLE.  Seven versions of SCSI seperated by software, the controler chip, and the port. Standarize the SOFTWARE and it DROPS to only FIVE versions of SCSI seperate by only HARDWARE {the chip and the port}	other

Sender: news@news.unomaha.edu (UNO Network News Server) Organization: University of Nebraska at Omaha Date: Wed, 21 Apr 1993 19:38:12 GMT Lines: 227 	------------------------------------- 	+ ............The OTIS Project '93  + 	+ ""The Operative Term Is STIMULATE"" + 	------------------------------------- 	---this file last updated..4-21-93--- WHAT IS OTIS? OTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork and photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny, and distribution.  Digital immortality. The basic idea behind ""digital immortality"" is that computer networks are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the artifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they'll be put in different formats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll be there...and someone will dig them up. If that doesn't interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is breathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons. Spectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and let the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own copies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption... that's what they're here for. --------------------------------------------------------------- WHERE? OTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.  	141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site 	sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite 	(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well) Merely ""anonymous FTP"" to either site on Internet and change to the appropriate directory.  Don't forget to get busy and use the ""bin"" command to make sure you're in binary. OTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North America....the following systems have a substancial supply of OTIStuff... 	Underground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines 	CyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron -------------------------------------------------------------- HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE? What happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely photo, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put it in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me (email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received, it will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works are also welcome. OTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG. GIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to see.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at most large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit tougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer, you can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change JPG files to a standard GIF format. OTIS also accepts animation files. When you submit image files, please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people to view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll be having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of emailing). If you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send copies to: The OTIS Project c/o Ed Stastny PO BX 241113 Omaha, NE 68124-1113 I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will scan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back. Also include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to what the images are to be named, include those as well. Conversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please contact me and we'll arrange things. If you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5"" disk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back. This is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP, but do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM compatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or JPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather not have to. At senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they can stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send a blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to get a slab-o-OTIS. As of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing. Email me for current archive size and directory. -------------------------------------------------------------------- DISTRIBUTION? The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to another).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local bulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the appropriate text files along with the images. It would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images from OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is. It's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as possible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite BBS system....or even just post this ""info-file"" there.  It would be keen of you. -------------------------------------------------------------------- USE? If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory, you'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or full address credit).  You will either find this in the "".rm"" file for the image or series of images...or in the ""Artists"" directory under the Artists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have to contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email me (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for you, or give you their contact information. When you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist know about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files. --------------------------------------------------------------------- NAMING IMAGES? Please keep the names of your files in ""dos"" format.  That means, keep the filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or four digit ""code"" for the series of images, plus the series number. Thus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something like: 	ldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC Keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- CREATING IMAGE FILES? When creating image files, be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in case they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title, address or other information you'd like people to know. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HMMM?! That's about it for now.  More ""guidelines"" will be added as needed. Your input is expected. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS  	     (a sumerian deity) or it's followers, be they pope, priest, 	     or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations 	     however. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original  	     image files.  The files will go to the public at large. 	     It's possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone 	     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.     	     Unless you've given permission for that, it's illegal.  OTIS 	     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights 	     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to 	     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed 	     electronically.  If you don't want your images distributed 	     all-over, don't upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is 	     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or 	     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not 	     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software, 	     screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific 	     permission for this sort of usage. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Remember, the operative term is ""stimulate"".  If you know of people that'd be interested in this sort of thing...get them involved...kick'm in the booty....offer them free food...whatever... ....e  (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu)        (ed@sunsite.unc.edu) -- Ed Stastny           | OTIS Project, END PROCESS, SOUND News and Arts PO BX 241113	     | FTP: sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS) Omaha, NE 68124-1113 |      141.214.4.135 (projects/otis) ---------------------- EMail: ed@cwis.unomaha.edu, ed@sunsite.unc.edu"	other

[Deleted for space; basically complaints that xv is an 8 bit program and that making several modifications to the RGB sliders is slow because of screen updates.] In reverse order: 1) Try clicking in the auto-apply box to switch it off. Then make your mods. Then click on apply. There is no problem as stated; it has already been solved if you look carefully. 2) Yes XV is an 8 bit program. This is not a bug. You can edit individual pallette entries or do global colour changes; crop, scale etc. Clearly the program must save out the *altered* image else all your work would be thrown away. So yes it saves out 8 bit images - of course! XV can import 24 bit images and quantises them down to 8 bits. This is a handy facility, not a bug. How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more complicated. If you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image, you need much more powerfull software - which is readily available commercially. And lastly, JPEG is a compression algorithm. It can be applied to any image of arbitrary bit depth. Again, this is not a bug. It is a way of saving disk space ;-) Later, -- Chris Lilley ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Technical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project Computer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK.

It is easy to accomodate all the pixel ""descriptor"" (or color attributes) in those modes into A0000-AFFFFF, but not in 640x480x256(which is what I am interested in).  I haven't finish the book but I affraid the author didn't talk much about this mode(or other SVGA modes).  If anyone out there know any good book dealing with fast SVGA graphics manupulation(scrolling, repainting, all other good stuff..) please send me mail.  Programming guide to SVGA card is also welcome. 	Thanks in advance. ************************************************************************ *                         Tiang   T.

Everyone, Since some people quickly solved the problem of determining a sphere from 4 points, I suddenly recalled a problem which is how to find the ellipse from its offset. For example, given 5 points on the offset, can you find the original ellipse analytically? I spent two months solving this problem by using analytical method last year, but I failed. Under the pressure, I had to use other method - nonlinear programming technique to deal with this problem approximately. Any ideas will be greatly appreciated. Please post here, let the others share our interests. Yeh USC	other

E.g., a cylinder, a cone, a plane (of course!) or any surface or patch having vanishing Gaussian (intrinsic) curvature (i.e., with singular Hessian, the matrix of 2nd derivatives for an adequate coordinate patch) are ""developable"". In more technical words, a developable surface is ""locally isometric to a plane"" at all points. Think also of the sphere (or the earth) which in a non-developable: whatever way(s) you cut it, you will not be able to lay flat any pieces of it... (its intrinsic curvature is nowhere vanishing).

The intersection of 3 planes method looks best, but my implementation based on a short article in Graphics Gems I doesn't work.  I may be misinterpreting, of course. I had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor of dot and cross products, but the former may actually be better.  In either case a matrix determinant needs to be computed (implicitly in the solution of linear equations). To get the planes, I was taking the midpoint of the line from, say, P1 to P2, and setting the normal as the ""normalized"" vector from P1 to P2. These just plugged into the formula in Graphics Gems.  HOwever, the resulting center point is only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test points (for different tests).  My matrix/vector math is very rusty, but it looks like I need to verify the formula, or use the simultaneous equation solution, which will require bringing in another routine I don't have (but should be easy to find). Another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 2 sets of 3 points, and intersecting the normals from there.  This would also define the circle center.  However, small numerical imprecisions would make the lines not intersect.  Supposedly 3 planes HAVE to intersect in a unique point if they are not parallel.

I've implemented the ideas from the article above and I'm very satisfied with the results. I needed it for my bezier curve approximation routine. In some cases (generating offset curves) loops can occur. I now have a fast method of detecting the generation of a curve with a loop. Although I did not follow the article above strictly. The check if the fourth control point lies in the the loop area, which is bounded by two parabolas and one ellips is too complicated. Instead I enlarged the loop-area and surrounded it by for straight lines. The check is now simple and fast and my approximation routine never ever outputs self-intersecting bezier curves again!

A few years ago a friend and I took some 256 grey-level photos from a 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method. Displaying all 256 levels synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After experimenting with different aperture settings and screen brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no visible contrast bands. To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255 different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254, etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was very fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa. Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the top left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took an extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into the center of the print. Who'd have guessed? regards, Jon Rowlands	other

When connected to a PC with its processor card it can directly take HPGL, Targa and Lasergraphics Language files. 24 bit Targa is quite OK for raster images, but conversion from whatever one happens to have can be quite slow. This Lasergraphics Language seems to be (got the source file for one test image) a vector-based language that can handle one million colors. It does some polygons too, and perhaps something else ? The question is, where can I find some information about this language ? A FTP site, a book, a company address,.... ? (OK, it would be nice to have a Windows driver for it, but I'm not THAT optimistic...)

Asante EN/SC adapter. The 10Base-T connection works like a charm. I installed the newest drivers from Asante's ftp server. The problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain - specifically a 50MB drive. I power up the drive, then the Mac. The Mac tests memory, etc. Just before the ""happy Mac face"" normally shows up, the power light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use the network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the Asante box pretty much unusable. It doesn't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn on the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn't get noticed during the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter works, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has *never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I've had it for over a year). Here is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID's of the EN/SC and the disk -- several permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at the head or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator (both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal resistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying another identical drive; trying several different SCSI cables.

[as well as showing you that if you don't have a > marketing department to speak of, no one will care how good your system is] I've had the same experience actually. I love the Mac interface and any number of the features, but am sorely dissapointed with the speed. I use macs daily and am a Moc consultant for OSU Statistics department; I'm familiar with almost every model out there, and my experience is that both the Amiga and the Atari ST simply ""blow the Mac out of the water"" in terms of performance. At this time I would in general say that the other advantages of the Mac outweigh the advantages of the Amiga or the ST (and Falcon), but I really wish Apple would get their heads together on speed... :-((((( They could take a real lesson in muli-tasking from the Amiga OS or the MultiTOS in the Atari Falcons too :-(((  > I'm still happy with my ci, but I don't understand why the performance is > so bad (comparatively).  They could have done multi-tasking _properly_. > They could have done everthing else better -- but apple didn't. > (of course DOS 6 and windows 3.1 are nothin to write home about either!!) I just hope that someone comes out with a machine that does *everything* well someday. If I had my choice, I would go with Mac in most aspects, but add the speed and superior Multi-Tasking of the other platforms. As for the original topic; Trying to compare *just the chip* in a machine seems almost worthless. A fast 386 with a wiz-bang graphics accelerator will be faster in productivity for many applications than a even a stock Quadra. Add a graphics accelerator to a 486 and you *really fly*. Of course, add one the the Quadra and then you're blowing the 486 away... etc... > Oh well, y'all got $2.00 worth for the price of $0.02 I think mine was only worth $0.01....... ----------------------------------------------------------------------> |-! -David Butler- dhbutler@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu   ""This is not a novel to be tossed away lightly;    it should be thrown with great force.""         -Dorothy Parker"	other

I can produce similar artifacts. I am using a Centris 610 with an Apple 16"" monitor.  I got the 8/230/CD configuration, so there is on-board ethernet and 1 Megabyte of video ram. The effect only occurs in 256 color and 256 grey modes.  Any vertical scrolling operation, whether with a scrollbar or, say, using vi and inserting lines, will produce a scattering of horizontal flickering lines on the screen. They do not persist -- each is visible for perhaps one refresh, and then that part of the screen is back as usual. They seem to always start at or about the 64th pixel from the left, and are maybe 512 pixels wide.  This is certainly not preventing me from using my Macintosh ;-), but it does seem to be a sign of something perhaps grounded incorrectly in the video circuitry... I went ahead and called the Apple Customer Assistance Center, at:   1-800-776-2333, or 1-800-767-2775 (more direct?) The person who answered was polite :-).

It is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in any macintosh if you can find the space to put it. I have a IIsi that came with a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in another 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did. First off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum quarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them was stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a problem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for over two months. The next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal hard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just splice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard connector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare cable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found in any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly soldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of shorts or bad connections. Next, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk ribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what I did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another male connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again, and is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a crimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not damaged, and I can go back to the original setup. Having done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for power consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this day. In a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of the drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are intact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it seemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal should be terminated at all the ends. Let me know if you have any more questions. Peter Hansen Bell Northern Research pgmoffc@BNR.ca"	other

I have attempted to gather as many case histories as possible to find some estimate of success and risk. The number of replies probably shows how rare this modification is but give the impression that success rates may be higher than the previous 80% estimate. 24 of 24 machines were able to run at 25 mhz when no add on boards were present. This is not a scientific survey but it is the best we have to work with. Thanks to all who contributed to this poll. Issues: 	Speed) 25 mhz to 27.5 mhz appears to be the norm for machines without 		add on cards. All reported machines were able to use 		25 mhz as long as no add on cards were present. Several Apple 		Nubus cards were in use. No machine with the Nubus adapter 		was able to go faster than 25 mhz. One wasn't even able to 		achieve 25 mhz with the Nubus adapter in place 		At speeds of 32 and 33 mhz, the startup sound is distorted and 		hi density floppy disk problems have been reported. 		Note: Unless specifically listed below, machines were not 			tested with a higher speed clock to failure. Hence, 			the 25 mhz operational machines may well work at 			higher speeds. 	Damage) One user reported pulling out the plating of one pad. This was 		repaired and the machine is operational. One other 		reported pulling the pin out of the original clock oscillator 		during desoldering. There is one second hand report of a user 		putting a gash in the motherboard with a slipped soldering iron. 		No reports of static discharge damage. 		No reports of high speed operation causing damage. 		Then again, I also don't have any reports from users of 		defective parachutes. 	Add on boards) Compatibility appears to be a problem with Apple Nubus 		Adapters. Several other add on boards have been used with 		success. See case histories 	Heat Sinks) Virtually all modified machines had a heat sink installed. 		These were often the TO-220 style power transistor type. Some 		used epoxy. Some used a dab of heat sink compound with a dab 		of cyanoacrylate glue. There was also use of a clamp with a 		bolt through the hole in the motherboard. Case Histories: All speeds are the effective CPU speed (1/2 of clock oscillator). All reported CPU versions were 20 mhz. 1)  27.5 mhz operational. Ran for 10 minutes at 31 mhz before crashing.

Why would you dispose a channel if you are going to play more sounds soon? If you are trying to write a game, you shouldn't be using SndPlay. Instead, make a channel and use BufferCmds to play sounds on it. It works great. You can add CallBacks to the channel also to let you know when the channel is getting empty.

Callbacks are very reliable, I found them 100% reliable, even under System 4.1. I was doing continuous background sound with interrupting sound effects on System 6.0 with the IM-V documentation. You probably were cancelling your callback commands out of your channels, of course you didn't get called. In general, if you have problems with sounds working when you play one per channel and then close the channel (with the related slowdown), but then when you play more than one you don't work, then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a channel, possibly the same one multiple times. This might be because you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with a sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to the channel first thing before it plays. Most sampled sounds have this command at the start of them. You need to resedit the sound and remove that command, then when you create your channel, specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the channel's synth. Then you can use asynch sndplay's all you want. You'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd's, since you are going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks. Now before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it, and the sound manager doesn't work for games, remember, Spectre uses it. And it works great. If Spectre can spare the CPU time, you can too. One little disclaimer: There are some out there who say the Sound Manager in the IIsi can't be made to work right. I'm not sure either way, but I know for sure that you can make your sounds work 100% correctly on every other machine using the Sound Manager. -Steve	other

Perhaps the reason is simple--maybe the marketing people who put together the brochures and price lists weren't clear on the FPU issue. Afterall, Apple's literature is not always 100% correct. A funny one I noticed recently is that some of the brochures on the Macs with CD capability refer to the ""auto inkjet"" feature. This should have read ""auto inject"" feature (as it does on some other correct brochures I've seen from Apple). Since it was correct on some older brochures, I can only guess that someone edited the copy, saw ""inject"" and thought it was a typo and changed it to the more familiar word ""inkjet"". Hmmm, what would that be? A printer built into the CD player? A way of *writing* information to a CD? :-) :-)"	other

I suspect an internal adjustment would fix this. Anyone tried it? Another problem is sub-brightness: Areas that are meant to be black (or off the main raster) are not very black. The real raster is quite visible when the screen is blanked. This is not too severe, but it is just not as good as other Trini screens I have used. If I turn the brightness/contrast down so that the raster is not visible, the real image virtually disappears! The raster size is just right if I use 1024*768, but 100dpi+ is a bit too much!

According to accounts by those who were able to  save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful  events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then  taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people  well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these  places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun.  They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the  Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality  problem.

I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is  destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air.

It was for the purpose of establishing a state, not an exclusive state.  If the state was to be exclusive, it would not have 400 000 arab citizens. 	And no, I do not consider the purchase of land a hostile action.  When someone wants to buy land, and someone else is willing to sell it, at a mutually agreeable price, then that is commerce.  It is not a hostile action leading to war. >As to whether the Jews wanted to live in peace, maybe. >However they wanted and still want an exclusively Jewish >state, where Jews are in control and Jews are the masters of >the land.

Try again, you tell me what its isn't, but you fail to establish what it is. 	Also, Jews did have history in Israel for over a thousand years.  There were lots of Jews slaughtered by Crusaders in Israel. There was a thriving community in Gaza city from roughly 1200-1500. Jews were a majority in Jerusalem from 1870 or so onwards.

Lambrou) writes: >What about Cyprus?? The majority of the population is christian, but >your fellow Turkish friends DID and STILL DOING a 'good' job for you >by cleaning the area from christians. All your article reflects is your abundant ignorance. The people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July 15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop Makarios. Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with the aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right given by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently and conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island since 1571. The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the 'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences for this irresponsible conduct.             THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM 2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus It is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched against the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally killed in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage Greeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the 24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which has been converted into a museum. AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY GREEK TERRORISTS The date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the Greeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been going on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage bloodshed... The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent, are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the bathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their home. A glaring example of Greek barbarism. Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by Mr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded during the same terrible event. ""On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan. Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs. Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting having supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River direction started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain. Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was dangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought would be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We waited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing in the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her arms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open. Greeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house with  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard voices saying, in  Greek, ""You want Taksim eh!""  and then bullets started flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children fell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks, who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I heard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted. When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and her three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what had happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to the  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was brutally murdered. In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying ""Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?""  I became terrified. I thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not dead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself under the double-bed. An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My mouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some water. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the bathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I offered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who were all wounded. We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I thought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed to be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber and I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked as far as Koshklu Chiftlik. There, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were operated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs. Ayshe and her daughter. After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to Ankara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months treatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus, Greeks arrested me at the Airport. All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my detention. They then released me."" ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in which 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five days. We  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some terrible sights. In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A child's bicycle lay in a corner. In the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three children piled on top of their murdered mother. In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the head. This, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose family had been killed by the mob in the first violence. Today was five days later, and still they lay there. Rene MacCOLL and Daniel McGEACHIE, (From the ""DAILY EXPRESS"") ""...I saw in  a bathroom the bodies of a  mother and three infant children murdered because their father was a Turkish Officer..."" Max CLOS, LE FIGARO 25-26 January, 1964  Peter Moorhead reporting from the village of Skyloura, Cyprus.  Date : 1 January, 1964.  IL GIARNO (Italy)  THEY ARE TURK-HUNTING, THEY WANT TO EXTERMINATE THEM.  Discussions start in London; in Cyprus terror continues. Right now we  are witnessing the exodus of Turks from the villages. Thousands of people  abandoning homes, land, herds; Greek Cypriot terrorism is relentless. This  time, the rhetoric of the Hellenes and the bust of Plato do not suffice to  cover up barbaric and ferocious behaviors.  Article by Giorgo Bocca, Correspondent of Il Giorno  Date: 14 January 1964  DAILY HERALD (London)  AN APPALLING SIGHT And when I came across the Turkish homes they were an appalling sight. Apart from the walls, they just did not exist. I doubt if a napalm bomb attack could have created more devastation. I counted 40 blackened brick and concrete shells that had once been homes. Each house had been deliberately fired by petrol. Under red tile roofs which had caved in, I found a twisted mass of bed springs, children's conts and cribs, and ankle deep grey ashes of what had once been chairs, tables and wardrobes. In the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios, a mile away, I counted 16 wrecked and burned out homes. They were all Turkish Cypriot homes. From this village more than 100 Turkish Cypriots had also vanished.In neither village did I find a scrap of damage to any Greek Cypriot house.  DAILY TELEGRAPH (London)  GRAVES OF 12 SHOT TURKISH CYPRIOTS FOUND IN CYPRUS VILLAGE  Silent crowds gathered tonight outside the Red Crescent hospital in the  Turkish Sector of Nicosia, as the bodies of 9 Turkish Cypriots found  crudely buried outside the village of Ayios Vassilios, 13 miles away, were  brought to the hospital under the escort of the Parachute Regiment. Three  more bodies, including one of a woman, were discovered nearby but could  not be removed. Turkish Cypriots guarded by paratroops are still trying to  locate the bodies of 20 more believed to have been buried on the same site.

We had a most peculiar little locomotive, originally built in America for the Russian Government, adapted to burn either wood or oil; one covered truck as men's quarters; one similar, which I fitted up for my- self and a railway officer; and also a truck to carry wood, three cars being the utmost our small engine could pull. With this small outfit we started, rumours of all kinds reaching us before our departure indicating that the whole situation was rapidly coming to a head, it being evident that the Turks were becoming~ more and more restive in the face of the inexplicable delay of the Allies in reaching any definite decision with regard to the future. Travelling on this little ""war-time"" railway was indeed an experience, and it was necessary to carry a ""gauge,"" and to test the rails with it frequently, for in many places, owing to the sinking of the embankments and the washing away of the ballast, the rails required rectification before we were able to get our train over, even at a foot pace; each bridge also re- quired elaborate examination before adventuring the train upon it, and eventually we were obliged to carry large baulks of tim- ber to temporarily shore up many of the bridges and culverts whilst we passed over them. Under these circumstances it may be imagined that our prog- ress was by no means rapid, and as we had frequently to halt also to replenish our supply of wood fuel, we considered we had achieved wonders when, on the evening of the second day, 60 hours and 70 miles out from Erzeroum, we finally entered the gorge of the mountains where we understood our worst troubles to lie. This is the same gorge into which the road from Erzeroum to Kars descends from the foot-hills to cross the frontier; the railway, however, follows the main Aras River val- ley till the frontier gorge enters it, whilst the road cuts off the corner and joins the rail again at the frontier post of Zivin, some 15 miles from the main valley. Soon after entering the gorge, we were confronted by the first serious fall of rock--about 2,000 tons having fallen from the cliff face and entirely obliterated the railway track.

The reasons are pragmatic: even if >Bosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under >Turkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has any >clue what was their ancestor's actual nationality.  In fact, although I am forced to disagree with you. First of all, one may have been born from a non-Turkish, non-Muslim parent outside the Turkish land, yet still can be a Turk, provided this person calls himself or herself a Turk. Because the designation of a Turk is not a genetic feature, not a racial or religious feature. It is a matter of identifying with the Turkish values. Secondly, the following observations by Westerners were written in French by Ahmet Cevat: ""If Turks had behaved like Christians to use force to convert to Islam the nations which they brought under their power, to which no one could have opposed, today there would be no Eastern problem. But Turks did not do so. They obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody ""to worship in their own way"" centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus, in an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when people in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs differed from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the inquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and where accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkey was the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere by the Christians, could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslim countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian countries.""[1] ""The Turks, who are a conquering nation, did not Turkify the nations that came under their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions. It was a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of Russian or Austrian rule. Because otherwise there would not have been a Romanian nation today"" (Popescu Ciocanel). ""Turks rule over people under their administration only externally, without interfering with their internal structures. On account of this, the autonomy of minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most advanced European countries.""[2] ""...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. This flaw is older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examples of this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account of his religion. If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of simple contempt among us too, or if it did not keep translating itself into action, many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves happy!"" (A. de Mortraye).[3] ""Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the inquisition. On the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunate victims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history, you will see that in the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and Portugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years, and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the cruelty of Christians, especially that of the Orthodoxes. No Jew is able to appear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens, even today. In Turkey, however, if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities, local courts immediately take them under their protection."" ""In that vast and calm country of the sultan, all religions and nations are living together peacefully. Although the mosque is superior to the church and the synagogue, it does not replace them. Because of this, the Catholic sect is more free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon. In addition to the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this sect, neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While the dead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processional candles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches in the Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical processions during the Eucharist celebrations, chanting hymns and bearing their crosses and religious banners, a detachment of soldiers escorts them which forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of priests.""

Having lived in Europe I realize that incidences such as the one described in the letter have occured. The U.S. media as a whole seem to try to ignore them. The U.S. is subsidizing Israels existance and the Europeans are not (at least not to the same degree). So I think that might be a reason they report more clearly on the atrocities. 	What is a shame is that in Austria, daily reports of the inhuman acts commited by Israeli soldiers and the blessing received from the Government makes some of the Holocaust guilt go away.

Well, apparently we have another son of Dro 'the Butcher' to contend with. You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries. If you feel that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed. This is not a lecture to another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist, but a fact. I will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line, lie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide. We are neither in x-Soviet Union, nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship, that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest. Also, feel free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists, the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian criminal organizations. Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. You, and those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up. Not a chance.

The stories of survivors of Karabag massacre are in 'Milliyet' today. 69 year old Hatin Nine telling: -''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They told me: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.'' 72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu: - ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours.   While killing children and babies mercilessly they said: You are   Turks, you must die.'' 28 year old Gulsum Huseyin: - ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of     my eyes.'' Are these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming? Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region? The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British Journalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times article. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before Turkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures of people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off. Even the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these ""lies."" They are saying ""exaggeration."" That means ''somethings'' have happened but the situation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu town was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's 3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach... The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of this massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word. Some of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre. Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print no news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the French TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag was ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.'' The age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots of organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human rights violations. International reactions must be made with international cooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming to be civilized. Could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the right to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where is the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals, journalists, writers, TV stations of certain western countries such as France who are fast to claim leadership of ""human rights?"" Where are you?

They are news because they are the exceptions. And the 'Islamic Holocaust' is much the topic of the day. The historical evidence proves that during the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts of sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes, set up ambushes, attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts behind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly attacked Turkish and Kurdish villages, slaughtering the Turkish population indiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike. Innocent Muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with axes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt alive as can be seen below. Widespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions of Van, Kars, Sivas, Erzurum, Bitlis, Erzincan, Mus, Diyarbakir and Maras. The Ottoman Army, while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion, also had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from behind. The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of Eastern Anatolia. Starting from late 1914, Armenians committed widespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia, because the arena was left to the Armenians. Almost every Turkish town and village from Erzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide by Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian, Russian, American, British, Ottoman, German, Austrian and French journalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century committed by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads. The Ottoman Army, liberating Trabzon, Bayburt, Erzincan, Erzurum, Kars and other regions from the Russians, saw that the cities and their villages had been destroyed and burnt, people slaughtered, massacred. The massacres conducted by Armenians, which became a black stain for humanity, shocked and disgusted even the Russian, British, German, Austrian, French and American authorities. Almost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and cruelties. The inhuman treatment, cruelties, atrocities, genocide by Armenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish and Kurdish people, are sufficiently reflected in historical documents. Even today over seventy-five years later, the terrifying screams of the victims of these cruelties can be heard. Source: Documents: Volume I (1919).

""I have been closely following for two weeks the withdrawal of Russians and  Armenians from Turkish territories through Armenia. Although two months  have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs, I  have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at  almost every step. All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from  Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly  slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to  save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful  events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then  taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people  well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these  places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun.  They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the  Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality  problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers  who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and  Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the  Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs.  I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is  destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air. Although there are  speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as  well, I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard, but there is  proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war.""

Oh great.   Today's headlines tell us that the Croatians and Bosnians are fighting   each other throughout central Bosnia, in battles that the UN describes   as ""out of control"" and atrocities being reported from both sides.   These people are crazy.   Right now the Serbians are Number One in violations of human rights   and general carnage but crazed violence in the Balkans is like the   car-rental business - if you're Number Two you just try harder.   The region doesn't need military aid; it needs psychiatric help!   We should bomb them with Thorazine and then air-drop several   regiments of psychotherapists.   There is no justification for US military involvement because there   is no reasonable, definable goal we can achieve militarily.  Sure,   if send in several divisions of mechanized infantry we can probably   stop the more egregious fighting; but only as long as we are willing   to stay in there and play policeman and get shot at.  The minute we   leave or turn our backs they'll be at each other's throats again.   BTW, with Bosnia's large Moslem population, why have nations like   Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Egypt, and others with either money   or strong military forces not spoken out more forcibly or offered   to help out Bosnia?   The Turkish ambassador has ocassionally said   a thing or two, but that's all; I see no great enthusism from any   of those places to get *their* hands dirty.    Why does the US always   get stuck with this stuff?   Besides, there's no case that can be made for US military involvement   there that doesn't apply equally well to, say, Liberia, Angola, or   (it appears with the Khmer Rouge's new campaign) Cambodia.

You mean he talks about those Jews, who, because of their self hatred, spend all their time attacking Judaism, Jews, and Israel, using the most despicable of anti-Semetic stereotypes? 	I don't think we need to coin a term like ""Jedeo-Nazism"" to refer to those Jews who, in their endless desire to be accepted by the Nazis, do their dirty work for them.

First, my above statement doesnot say that ""the existence of israeli citizens    in the WB revoke their right of life"" but it says ""the israeli occupation    of the WB revoke the right of life for some/most its citizens - basically    revokes the right of for its military men"". Clearly, occupation is an    undeclared war; during war, attacks against military targets are fully legitimate. Ok, let me re-phrase the question. I have repeatedly asked you if the Israelis have less human rights than the palestinians, and if so, why. From your posting (where you did not directly adress my question) I inferred that you thought so. Together with the above statement I then assumed that the reason was the actions of the state of Israel. Re: your statement of occupation: I'd like you to define the term, so I don't have to repeat this 'drag the answer out of hasan' procedure more than neccesary.    Secondly, surely israeli have human rights, but they ask their goverment to    protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories, not by further oppressing    Palestinean human rights. I'm sorry, but the above sentence does not make sense. Please rephrase it.    |> If a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions, then    |> tell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all?    Because not all states are like Israel, as oppressive, as ignorant, or as tyrant. Oh, ok. So how about the human rights of the Syrians, Iraqis and others? Does the name of Hama sound familiar? Or how about the kurds in Iraq and Turkey? How about the Same in Sweden (Ok, maybe a bit farfetched..) the Russians in the Baltic states or the Moslem in the old USSR and Yugoslavia?

[1] Born 1964 Secretary-Typist Azsantekmontazh Trust Sumgait Construction and Installation Administration Secretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15 Microdistrict No. 3 Sumgait [Azerbaijan] On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show, at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards away. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, ""The Abyss."" Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at the City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the film. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do to Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina. It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's only opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats. Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis, people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, ""OK, we've scared them enough, let's leave."" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of ""anasha"", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine, and it was dark . . . Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. Lenin Street was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting, something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially listening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation wasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief- stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well, since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we live literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it was dark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the driver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well, OK . . . So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation was at a standstill and everyone was shouting ""Ka-ra-bagh,"" they're not going to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's immediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had come, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway, just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though nothing had happened. That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and didn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on. That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn't guess. On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always had. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda, Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at home and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda Zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did our apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something awful was happening in town. I asked, ""Don't they want Armenians? Well what are they after, if they're already in that state?"" She says, no, nothing like that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare. Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera, asked him, ""Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?"" Papa didn't know what she was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home and told Mamma. Mamma said, ""Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on."" But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian, she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I tell Lyuda, ""Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see you out."" Mamma says, ""You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can see what the situation in town is."" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was ready. Mamma says, ""Let her eat with us, then she can go."" We sat down at the table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating. We turned on the television, and the show ""In Fairy-Tale Land"" was coming on. We cleared the table. We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people . . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking somewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's an Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down to look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their feet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak . . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . . If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he got up and left or not. I become terrified and go home and say, ""Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . "" Then the crowd runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and kept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop them. They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows, afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous din and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were shouting Father's name, ""Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,"" or something like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma says, ""Into the bedroom, quickly!"" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part of our dowry; Mamma says, ""Hide there, they probably won't come in there, they'll ask something, say something, and leave."" She says, ""We'll tell them that we live alone here."" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say that I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and Lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told her anything or not. Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here, leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I tell them, ""What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what has happened."" In Azerbaijani, they say, ""Get out of the apartment, leave."" I say, ""OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the apartment."" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the doorway, the young guys, say, ""There are old people and one girl with them. Too bad!"" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, commanding them: ""Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?"" And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one room, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body, and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among themselves who would go first. Later, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes in, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything depends on him. He looks and says, ""Well, we're done here."" They are beating Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs . . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the windows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking about being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that I'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they don't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing . . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside. I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone else is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near the entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What happened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember. I come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me clothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember that I said the same words over and over again: ""Mamma, what happened, Mamma, what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?"" I can't make sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he served in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served there, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying, ""Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them."" How do I know who's who and what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then Papa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda said that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the Russians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going to tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in there. So they survived. My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things. While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, ""I'm not going to let you in the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings and we'll leave the building."" Lyuda says, ""I'll stay at your place because of what's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs."" It was just for a moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came back to our place and lay under the bed . . . I came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he came to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct. There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, it was hard to breathe . . . My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, without stopping. After us. I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from Buildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died from Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building. Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, ""Run quickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay alive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away."" At that moment three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face was pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of the soldiers said, ""Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan."" So at that point the Daghestan police were there. When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there, there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know, maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda and me and said, ""These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't know what to do with the rest."" So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My boss said, ""Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter what happens."" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department head from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life. That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, ""God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?"" She looks me over and says, ""Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been doing, your people did even worse things."" And I think, great, I have to deal with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't have the energy to say, ""How could our people possibly be smart enough to think of something that yours haven't already done?"" I stayed there. Then they brought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This was in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything more than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer, nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at them. I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur- pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face was disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, ""Better to ask your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can better explain what happened."" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward. Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up above my knees, and the woman orderly said, ""I can't believe you put on such a short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?"" I went back to my ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I couldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said that I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an Armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on the street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night. The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, and off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to the club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening. I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait after that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. I didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each other and asking, ""What happened, what went on?"" Two days later they came to see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they could. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions, neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart . . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by myself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my lungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be from all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular. When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. There was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic. They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I needed at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty breathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me. They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some people saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I wasn't cut. They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, ""We demand that Seidov come!"" The response was, ""It's Seidov who sent us."" Seidov is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, ""We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you agitators."" And so on. More of them said, ""Have Seidov himself come."" This went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a club that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill. Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting right and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to the attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and couldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the theater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my eyes. Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, ""Aren't you an Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani."" They led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did not have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like they should have, with their IDs. So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed, they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter- in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were already in the city. They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire families. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians or not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult now to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people, including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in Microdistrict 3. They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians out and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira G., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and she still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and carried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that. I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They couldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me, she couldn't remember anyone's face. I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw the Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. She goes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint meetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is from Armenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia. They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the Procuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden- tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They showed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our case, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were the ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these people, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they were all from Kafan. The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was there when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since I told him, ""Listen, you do something, because you know me."" He turned away and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one we're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, ""If he's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not responsible for my words."" He said, ""What did they do to you, how awful, myself, I hid an Armenian family."" Then after some time goes by he comes back again and says something entirely different: ""I wasn't at home, my family and I went to Baku."" I said, ""Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally different before."" After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me that Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. What are they doing with Rzayev? Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the head I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the same time I'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat- ter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one wasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what exactly I can't say. When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it, because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed, they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he works at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41, is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ dormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they even have proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our building was killed, it was that man. A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was all over, people started making announcements in town saying that investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now they've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've been beating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy came to the plant and said, ""Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the bus station on Saturday at ten."" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to, went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday night. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent, probably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn't say anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go, because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from I've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied with them thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know. His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time. His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at curfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this, the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did, I can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment. At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this, all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a look at him and thought, ""My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like you."" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over the table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that Armenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our apartment. I don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would have said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but probably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at a free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were being fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have been fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, ""Karina, we saw all of it, how could it happen?"" They're asking me! Well I just don't know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She came down to the entryway and said, ""You'll come in this entryway over my dead body."" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't even know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very well what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They couldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani stopped them. They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that? Maybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They didn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They screamed and screamed: ""Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!"" Only they didn't shout ""kill,"" they shouted ""gurun ermianlary."" Gurun literally means ""kill,"" or ""destroy."" That's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's an Azerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't find Lyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things, but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the courage to . . . A boy said to my mother ""Where's the gold?"" Mamma said he must have been 12 to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma thinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth, bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, ""What's happened?"" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, ""At least go and find out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or murdered them, at least bring the corpses."" He went looking for us. At that moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost her mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that way to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from outside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order it happened in. And Mamma said, ""Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting something or other, and running toward the other building."" It had more or less calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, ""Listen; let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how long we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything."" I don't get it, all women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, ""Mamma, what do you need any of that for? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!"" She says, ""No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the night at someone else's."" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son Alik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He shouts, ""Come back, they're coming!"" They didn't have enough time to get a lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore, out of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, they're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building, maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss. Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor, Asya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at that time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and her grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started pounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there, something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television. They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, ""My God, what is going on around here? When will this end?"" We turned off the lights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but they didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his apartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door. They tell him, ""Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of us."" He went upstairs, and they say, ""Aren't you taking anything from this apartment?"" He says, ""I don't need anything."" And the women who were standing in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really mad, and he says, ""Where's the rug? I just put it right here!"" They tell him, ""Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school."" He ran off in that direction. Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms, there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They just didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man, she didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them, the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, ""Where's the girl who was here?"" And he became furious. The woman tells him, ""She came to . . . "" She didn't know what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, ""She came to and went to the basement."" Now, our basement is full of water. So the whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there to get me. Then one of them said, ""There's so much water down there, she probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in the basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!"" I didn't know that, and when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . . After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really didn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think that they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been enough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?"" That's all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are you doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, ""If you want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment."" So she left. That trick didn't work on them. Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget that it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it had happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them, then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister. And no one did anything. Anything.

Trying to make comparisons between Israels politics and Nazi German-   Austrian politics shows only your degree of ignorance (high), intellect   (low), humanity (none) and antisemitism (average). I respect anybody   who dissagrees with me as long as he respects me and discusses in a   civilized manner. I would never say that anybody that critizises Israel   and/or its politics is an antisemite, except he uses antisemitic   vocabulary/terminology/demagogy. Israel is not a perfect country and   its politicians also commits errors, even some of them are corrupt   (like politicians in any other country), but they carry a huge burden:   to care for the safety of ALL its citizens, and that is really not an   easy task in a country that is surrounded by enemies who only expect   that Israel commits the ONE BIG ERROR and wipe the country (and its   Jewish citizens plus the so-called collaborators, arabs that wanted to   live in peace with their Jewish neighbours) of the map. As I said,   Israel is not a perfect country, but it is the ONLY democracy in the   whole Middle-East and the only country in the world where Jews from   everywhere can have a refuge in case of persecutions in the countries   they are living.   Our long history has taught us that we cannot rely on non-Jewish   nations and its governments: as soon as there are more or les big   social-economical-political problems in any country, the first ones   that pay for the broken glasses are the Jews, and later the other   minorities of the country. > I don't think the suffering of some Jews during WWII                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > justifies the crimes commited by the Israeli government.

This is really outrageous: 6.000.000 murdered Jews, besides the   thousands  who survived the Shoa in some way or another, and the rest   of the living ones mourning for all of them ! I don't know what you   call a ""Civil Libertarian"" (never heard about them) but I know only   one thing: if all of them think like you do it, then ""Civil Libertarians""   is a new denomination for Antisemites. May other Civil Libertarians come   to word to this group so that we can learn if A.Beyer and me are right   (that Civil Libertarians are Antisemites), or that I'm wrong and he is   missusing that word.

The justice is long overdue and the victims of the Turkish Genocide demand: 1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide; 2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and Kurdish people; 3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide; 4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian political pressure; 5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands; 6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of 2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.

If Irgun had to attack civilian targets to terrorize in order that they might obtain some objective, I'm sure they would have done so.  I also don't exclude Irgun's action against British soldiers as terrorism. The British were showing signs of favoring a compromise with regards to Palestine, and the Irgun and branch off groups made a point to kill young British recruits so that mothers and fathers back in Britain would get angry at Britains continued presence in Palestine.  Sounds like a form of terrorism to me, and not much removed from Arab terrorism.  We must not also forget that Irgun, or Irgun branch off groups [more likely] killed many jews who were not as hardline zionist as they, or who cooperated with the British. 	I'll reiterate again.... both sides are screwy, but I'll favor the underdog in this case because I do think they were a bit screwed."	other

There are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [1], and the number has been in decline since early this century [2].  Most of these accidents involve rifles or shot guns, not handguns. ... >But seriously: a gun is designed to fire a bullet.   This is not so you >can shoot cardboard cut outs down at the range. In fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that. The idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliber handgun) was designed to kill or hurt people, even for self defense, would, I'm sure, come as a surprise to its designer.  It certainly isn't why I have it.  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it, and might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to kill people. >This is not designed to act as a tool for home  defence where you show >someone  that you have a gun and they go ""Gee, perhaps I should leave"". In fact, that is what happens most of the time.  Most self defensive uses of firearms don't involve firing any shots.  Most criminals would prefer not to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing what you say when you point a gun at them. If you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, to immediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  A handgun is about the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work the best.[3] >No, you see the gun was designed to fire that little bullet into a human >body and hurt them.  Not a tough concept to swallow, for most. Certainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing) aren't deadly weapons.  However, it simply isn't true to say that all of them were designed to kill people.  Moreover, what exactly is wrong with having deadly weapons?  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to use deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  I consider it not just my right, but my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and knowing how to use the tools to do that. ""The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government."" 	- T. Jefferson. I think what Jefferson said is still true. >And the trouble with having such an item is often the little bullet goes >off into the wrong fleshy target. Not very often compared to other use.[3] >Or else Uncle Frank gets pissed and blows  away his wife. This isn't that common either, at least when compared to other uses.  It is very rare that a non-violent person will suddenly ""get-pissed"" and kill someone, gun or not.  In most cases, the people who murder have long histories of violence.  If you have good reason to believe that these people wouldn't kill if they didn't have a gun, feel free to present it. >Having a thing  specificly designed to kill means it is much easier to >kill things.  Right? Right, but there are times when killing things is called for.  I hope I never have to shoot a person, but I've had to kill a number of animals from rodents to cows, and when I do, I don't want them to suffer any more than is necessary.  I prefer they die instantly, but failing that, I want them to drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that, I don't want them to go fast or far.  I try to choose the best weapon and ammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I'm after, but it doesn't always work as I plan.  Without belaboring the point, people who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns, particularly handguns, haven't used them much for that purpose.

Michigan Avenue, Chicago IL  606111  (800) 621-7619 [2] RKBA.002 - Declining trend of accidental deaths by firearms            Version 1.1 (last changed on 90/04/23 at 22:28:19) DESCRIPTION =========== The accidental deaths by firearm per capita has been declining steadily for almost sixty years. In 1932, the accidental deaths by firearm per 1,000,000 people was 24.03. In 1987, it was 5.74. The decline has been steady, consistent, and a fairly straight line when plotted. At the rate of the last sixty years, it will reach zero sometime around 2025 AD. CONCLUSION ========== Firearms have been a declining factor in accidental deaths for over sixty years, despite rising per-capita gun ownership. [1] = Year. [2] = Population. [3] = Accidental deaths.

The availability of them in the USA makes them the preferred : murder weapon, but ban them, and some other weapon will step in as the : favorite. As a ""favorite"", sure.  As lethal, not likely.  A study of violence in Chicago produced this table: 		Percentage of Reported Gun and Knife Attacks 			    Resulting in Death 	Weapon				Deaths As Percentage of Attacks 	--------------------------------------------------------------- 	Knives (16,518 total attacks)		 2.4 	Guns (6,350 total attacks)		12.2 	Source: Firearms and Violence in American Life It might be contended that if gun murderers were deprived of guns that they would find a way to kill as often with knives.  If this were so, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide would be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in cities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would show a higher fatality rate.  But the Nat'l Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this not to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife attacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks (which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants), the proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the proportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true. What was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on the part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended to show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave physical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the head neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this pattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of rage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.

England has essentially legalized drugs, : so there are no drug gangs battling for turf, etc., there.  If you drop out the : drug related killings here, the USA would look a whole lot more peaceful. There are a lot of factors which make a difference.  Actually, I'm not fond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and Americans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic differences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found myself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I don't think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent crime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every law-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi. On the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more culturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive, seven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates of Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities with roughly the same population, urban economy, geography and crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control. In Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After a 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed weapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted. In Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason to purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted. Recreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are regulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a restricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in order to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns transported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box. In short, gun control but not unreasonably so. Both cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for gun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers studied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated), burglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from 1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the same standard: the FBI's Unified Crime Report. Results: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver (1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99). 18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in Vancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 / 1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher (1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by weapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged. Although both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated assault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were far more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often. Over the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle (11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000). After adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations, the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as compared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63. When homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate of homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in Seattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver. Virtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to a more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns accounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns were 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than in Vancouver. The authors of the report also investigated ""legally justifiable"" homicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during the seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only 21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in Seattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After excluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these earlier findings. ------- This is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make the argument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because Vancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times that of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports annual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC, Chicago, Los Angeles and Houston. Critics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access to handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because persons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a gun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently. If the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by the strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we could expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to be higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the study interval, Vancouver's rate of homicide by weapons other than guns was not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that few would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods. As well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding citizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did experience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these cases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities during the course of the study period.  And, as was reported, Seattle apparently didn't enjoy relief from any crime category over Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for self-defense.

In order to more clearly understand scripture, one must look in the context of where the verse is found.  The section you refer to here is found in Luke 22.  I'd like to start back at verse 35 and I'll include it here for the sake of completeness:    Then Jesus asked them, ""When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals,    did you lack anything?""    ""Nothing."" the disciples replied. Verse 36 says:  ""But now, if you have a purse take it and also a bag; and     if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.  It is written,     ""And he was numbered with the transgressors."" Verse 38 says:  The disciples said, ""See, Lord, here are two swords.""                 ""That is enough.""  he replied. What does this all mean? In verse 35, Jesus points out to the disciples that when he sent them out previously, they did not need to take anything with them.  Their food, lodging and transport were often provided through the generosity of others. If verse 36, Jesus alludes to the change in attitude that is to come in the near future.  Remember, Jesus was saying these things shortly before he was to be arrested.  In verse 36, He tells the disciples that they will have to take their own possessions and provisions with them.  THey will have to carry their own purse because there will be no longer any generosity from anyone.  And there will be times of peril when they will have to take care of themselves.  This was implied by the reference to the sword.  Jesus knew that He was going to be arrested and labeled as a criminal.  The charges brought against Him were likely to be passed on to his disciples. In verse 38, we see that the disciples have taken Jesus too literally.  It is not the first time that the disciples got His message wrong.  They had done this on several occassions.  Instead of understanding the gist of His words, they presented Him with two swords.  Jesus was perhaps taken aback by this promptly concludes the discussion by saying, ""That is enough."" The disciples could not understand why Jesus had to die.  Jesus kept telling them over and over again that He would soon not be with them but they could not grasp this.  They wanted their Messiah to be a political leader who would lead them in rebellion against the Romans.  That is why they were so keen on presenting Him with the swords.  They had no idea that Jesus was referring to a different kingdom of which they were to be a part of.  The disciples could only perceive of a kingdom on earth rather than the one in Heaven. Understand that Jesus NEVER intended his followers to take up arms in rebellion. This was clearly in evidence in Luke 22:51 when Jesus rebuked his disciples for using the sword against the servant of the high priest when they came to arrest Him.  As further evidence, Jesus goes so far as to heal the man injured by the disciples.  Jesus did NOT condone violence as a means for His purpose. Contrast this behaviour with that of David Koresh and you will clearly see that DK was NOT Jesus as he claimed.  Jesus surrendered himself to the authourities and allowed himself to be crucified.  He didn't go out in a blaze of glory, but rather Jesus was executed like a common criminal. I hope this makes it a little more clear.

Therefore it is Davids fault and not the ATF's who gave them 50 to 51 days to get out, this was 50 days to many for me and for many of the rest of the U.S.  I am however sad to hear of the death of any child unlike the sick bastard I supposedly am. -- +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Matthew R.

The simple fact of the matter is this:  Ten years ago they crowed about how great their system was because they'd gotten rid of the guns and the U.S. would be so much better if they'd just get into the divine light shining from the North.  We pointed out that it was cultural differences, and pointed to their pre-control crime rates.  We also pointed out that the history of the entire world contained smuggling, and that whenever something was wanted, it was smuggled in.        If the problem were based on U.S. guns, it would have surfaced years before.        Now more Canadian criminals want guns.  And they are being provided.

Delta Force?  The BATF had more than enough equipment and men.  They did not have good intel, but they did have poor planning.  They fucked up.  Even in just the most basic military sense, they fucked up.  Excuses do not justify body counts. >The BATF needs more people, better weapons and more armored >transports.

And your excuses fall upon deaf ears when the same BATF has shown shitty leadership despite more people, better weapons, and exclusive use of armor against their targets.  BATF is nothing more than a private army of the government.  Do the agents swear an oath, as I did, to uphold the Constitution?  You know, that document that stipulates the highest law of the land?  If they do, they should be up for charges in a court of law.  Remember, the law?  That's the whole reason for any of this. >With the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is needed >more now then ever.

Mind if I sight in my guns on your body?  Think of it as the price you have to pay that we may all live without fear of my making a stray shot.  It's fine and dandy to revel in the other guy being the target and your supposed safety.  In the military, we called this ""chicken shit.""  Leadership from the rear.

I'm sure we could all file it under ""civic improvement"" and your life wouldn't have been sacrificed in vain.  If you like, you can will your estate to defecit reduction, too.

Compared to what most criminals use, a 9mm with military ammo (FMJs), or a military rifle (use is extremely rare), .223 or 7.62mm with military ammo (FMJs), the .32 H&R magnum with ""civie"" bullets is more lethal.  Most of the arms which criminals (and the military) use are among the least lethal arms in existance. What if we just punish the criminal and leave the law abiding citizen alone?  It hasn't been tried in recient times, but it might work."	talk.politics.guns

Alas, I was speaking of principle.  Without principle, all attempts at republican forms of gov't are futile.

If we are indeed talking about CS, then this is not quite accurate. CS is ""just"" tear gas--albeit the worst kind. It isn't a nausea gas, and doesn't have direct CNS effects. However, it's quite bad--much worse than CN gas. I was briefly exposed to it once (during an engagement in Berkeley circa 1968 8^) and it's not the kind of thing you forget. It seems to be moisture-activated--it not only made my eyes sting and water, but attacked my breathing passages and lungs. Breathing was painful, and my entire face felt as if it was on fire. These effects persisted for hours after exposure, and I was coughing for days afterwards.  If I was exposed to a dense concentration of this stuff in a closed space for several hours, I doubt whether I could find the exit. Indeed, I can't imagine living through it. -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~              |      Die Welt ist alles, was Zerfall ist.     | Peter Cash   |       (apologies to Ludwig Wittgenstein)      |cash@convex.com ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"	talk.politics.guns

Opening statements were given by both the prosecution and the defense, each side presenting its version of what happenned last August. The prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved to Idaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the ""evil"" federal government.  The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federal agents ""sawed off"" shotguns and later failed to appear for trial: Despite repeated ""good faith"" efforts to get Weaver to surrender peacefully, Weaver refused.  The shootout erupted when Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and began firing.  According to the prosecution, three people were taking an ""offensive action"" against an FBI helicopter when an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver. The defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northern Idaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace.  They wanted simply to be left alone.  Weaver was induced by federal agents to sell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecution alleged, want to become a ""regular supplier"").  The defense also argued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver when he wouldn't become an informant [it is not specified explicitly, but I assume that this is a reference to the white separatist angle of the story.  We'll know more as things develop].  The failure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was given an incorrect court date and then indicted before that date. The shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killed Weaver's dog that was in proximity to Weaver's son, Samuel.  Weaver then fired in self-defense.  In the ensuing battle, federal agent William Degan was killed (when his gun was later found, there were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic: However, agents were near the body for an extended period of time and could have played with the select-fire - this will have to be more fully explained).  Finally, the defense claims that Vicki Weaver was only going to ""look at the body"" [not recover?] of her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper. Prosecution quote: ""Weaver wanted that confrontation, and he made that confrontation."" -- Asst. U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist Defense quote: ""The evidence in this case is going to show that this is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are charged with crimes they didn't commit in order to cover crimes that the government did commit.""  -- Gerry Spence  [nice soundbite!] Notes: The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supporters heeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday's protests outside the courthouse.  However, the local NBC affiliate again had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including ""Tim"" again.  ""Tim"" claimed he was a skinhead, who were ""ordinary, working class people.""  He also claimed he was for ""white pride, not white power."" Outside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview with Bo Gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly what the government wants to smear Randy Weaver. In an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_, about a dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the courthouse.  These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spence in action, and to perhaps learn something from him.  Some tidbits: Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kent were volunteering their time to represent Weaver because they believed in him.  Spence, during his 90-minute opening statement, repeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on the defendants shoulders (Weaver broke down and cried during the recounting of his wife's death), and Spence compared the ""sawed off"" shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (another good one!). Today (Thursday, April 15th) the prosecution was scheduled to begin presenting evidence.

I believe that this is not quite correct. My understanding is that LDS is engaged on a project to ""convert"" the souls of deceased persons of other religions, in order to spare them from damnation and gain them entrance into heaven. To this end, the Church has compiled extensive genaeological records, so that they will know the names of people to convert. A long article in the New Yorker a few years ago described the LDS research methods in some detail (for example, some researchers pay visits to local native storytellers to learn the names of people long dead). This sounds like just the sort of lie that would be made up about any unusual religion, but the New Yorker story convinced me that there is some truth to it (the New Yorker used to do extensive fact-checking, and the story was quite detailed).

I'm currently looking at a copy of last Thursday's SF Chronicle and there is the typical one column Traders ad on page C7 in the Sports section. Not only that, but there is a part in the middle which rather prominently says ""WANTED: We pay cash for assault rifles and pistols."". Granted, I haven't seen today's paper yet. But I'd be surprised if there wasn't a Traders ad in it. It's probably worth it to write to the Chronicle (and other papers) anyway, because all their anti-gun editorials are disgusting. By the way, let me put in a plug for Traders. I have shopped all over the SF Bay Area and I have never seen another store with lower prices.

Is Kratz certain that he can distinguish a three position switch from a two position switch via TV inspection?  (Does he even get to see the switch in the typical police display of guns?)

If the BD were violent they would have held the ATF agents as hostages.  They would not have released them like they did.  If they had kept the agents hostage they could have used them as bargening chips for medical attention etc. A big thing is being made of the BD collection of weapons but no one has shown that they had any plans to use them.  It is also apparent that the BD did not have any military training.  If they had, they could have dug bunkers and trenches and increased their fortifications.  They could have shot out the lights and speakers.  It appears that the BD were not violent, they shot back at the attacking ATF agents out of panic.

A problem occurs when I try to create a window with a visual that is different from the visual of the parent (which uses the default visual which is TC24). In the Xlib reference guide from 'O reilly one can read in the section about XCteateWindow, something like: ""In the current implementation of X11: When using a visual other than the parent's, be sure to create or find a suitable colourmap which is to be used in the window attributes when creating, or else a BadMatch occurs."" This warning, strangely enough, is only mentioned in the newer editions of the X11R5 guides. However, even if I pass along a suitable colourmap, I still get a BadMatch when I create a window with a non-default visual. The code looks like this: ------------------ cut here and you'll destroy your CRT ---------------- Window create_8bit_window_on_truecolour_display(dpy,width,height) Display *dpy; int width, height; {   Window win;   XVisualInfo vinfo;   XSetWindowAttributes attr;   fprintf(stderr,""Opening 8 bit window...\n"");   if (!XMatchVisualInfo(dpy,DefaultScreen(dpy),8,PseudoColor,&vinfo)) {     fprintf(stderr,""Your display can't handle 8 bit PseudoColor.\n"");     exit(1);   }   fprintf(stderr,""Using visual: %x\n"",vinfo.visual->visualid);   cmap = XCreateColormap(            dpy,            DefaultRootWindow(dpy),            vinfo.visual,            AllocNone          );   XSync(dpy,False);   XInstallColormap(dpy,cmap);	/* ommision of this line gives same result */   attr.colormap = cmap;   win = XCreateWindow(           dpy,           DefaultRootWindow(dpy),           10,10,           width,height,           CopyFromParent,       /* border width */           8,                    /* depth */           InputOutput,          /* class */           vinfo.visual,         /* visual */           CWColormap,           &attr         );   return win; } --- cut here and you'll destroy your CRT ----- Executing this piece of code results in a BadMatch error.

Since the dialog is modal, mwm won't allow keyboard focus onto your main shell, and so it won't allow cmap focus either. Since it sounds as though you have keyboardFocusPolicy:pointer, I suggest you set colormapFocusPolicy:pointer also.  That way, the cmap focus won't slavishly follow keyboard focus, but will beat its own path. (if you have keyboardFocusPolicy: explicit, you can set cmap focus explicit also, but you then need a binding to f.focus_color, probably on MB1). -- David Brooks					dbrooks@osf.org Open Software Foundation			uunet!osf.org!dbrooks Showres soote my foote"	other

""multi-headed"" tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors, sometimes even multiple screens even if they're multiplexed onto the same monitor (eg, a Sun with a cg4 display).  ""multi-screen"" and ""multi-display"" would, if taken strictly, mean different things, but since the strict meaning of ""multi-display"" would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and pointers, when it's used it probably refers to the same thing ""multi-screen"" would: a system that provides multiple Screens.

There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at most 255 Screens.  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays on a single invocation, unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can be looked upon as such; on a TCP-based system there is necessarily a limit of 65535 Displays per machine, but this is not a limitation inherent to X. What you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular implementation (probably the MIT one).  If it claimed there was a limit of 12 inherent to X, the author of the article had no business writing about X. 					der Mouse 				mouse@mcrcim.mcgill.edu"	other

I decided to implement an animated cursor (using 6 created cursors) by calling XDefineCursor from a SIG_ALRM signal handler. This is used to indicate we are waiting for a operator request to complete. (on a production control system). I was redrawing the screen underneath the animated cursor and then restoring the standard cursor when complete. I found dumped core , and upon analysis it was when the SIG_ALRM handler was called during a XDrawString call. XDrawString was doing a bcopy (presumably an internal structure) when the XDefineCursor was called. Presumably the (internal) structure that XDrawString was manipulating was not in a stable state and sent XDefineCursor to where it shouldn't have been. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there any official documentation that says you should ensure this doesn't happen? Or should bcopy() be atomic.

Anyway, what you say is not really true. The color information is associated with a GraphicsContext, not with a display, and the GC _IS_ a parameter to the drawing routines. So, if you need to fast switch between green dotted lines and blue ones of width 2, you can make 2 GCs for those cases and then simply do XDrawLine(dpy,win,gc_red,x1,y1,x2,y2); XDrawLine(dpy,win,gc_blue,x3,y3,x4,y4); for this effect. This is eventually more complicated to do for the programmer, but also much more efficient and flexible. You would not include all the other parameters like line pattern, with, cap and joinstyle, drawmode and so on in every drawing call, so why do it for color ? BTW, stay away from XDrawPoint() if you don't really need it (to draw RANDOM points), for image transfers there are Image routines. -- +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+ | o |                \\\-  Brain Inside -///                       | o | | o |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           | o | | o | Andre' Beck (ABPSoft) mehl: Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de | o | +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+	other

May I humbly suggest DESQview/X? (Of course, I'm biased...) DESQview/X is a multitasker for DOS computers, that uses a standard X11R4 server as it's display mechanism. DOS applications and Microsoft Windows standard mode are converted on-the-fly to X-protocol, allowing you to display them, or any R4 compatable X-program from any machine on the net to display to the PC's local display (or to any other display on the net). Free tools are available for devloping X-applications for the DVX platform; many X-programs have been ported between DVX and UNIX with little or no modifications. (Often, you only need to create a new makefile!)

A hundred of them on a single ethernet might be >a problem, but a couple dozen should be fine. Bandwidth is unlikely to be the problem, except over a wet string network. One of major flaws of X is the horrendous number of transactions (and hence process switches) that it forces upon a host.  Actual measurements (hourly average) are 5 per second per logged in user, which can lead to 20-50 or more process switches (depending on whether each event is filtered by the window manager as well as the applications and how many processes are needed for each character.) While a blinking cursor needs only the application and the networking process, and does not add any transactions, it will add something like 10 process switches per second per user.  This is a significant increase in overhead, especially as the application may have quite a large working set.  If you want a rapidly blinking cursor, there could be as many as 50. If you want to go there, I wouldn't start from here! Nick Maclaren University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory, New Museums Site, Pembroke Street, Cambridge CB2 3QG, England.

On those three, I am unable to use the X11R5 libraries to build Motif clients, because I get link errors between the vendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this same problem when X11R6 becomes available.   The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5, since I do not have Motif compiled under X11R5. True, I could buy another port of Motif, but that sort of ruins the whole idea of ""free"", doesn't it?

What I'd like to see is this scenario: Each widget, view, whatever, describes it's colors via a palette. Palettes can be shared and they only contain descriptive information. They are not directly tied to the object that uses them.  Palettes are held in the server.  A palette can accomadate, up to, the number of hardware color cells of color descriptors. When the input focus is in a particular widget, that widget has access to all of the colors that are described in its associated palette.  ALL OTHER WIDGETS, TRANSIENTLY, GET THE CLOSEST APPROXIMATION THAT CAN BE GENERATED BY A UNION OF THE COLORS FROM THE CURRENT PALETTE AND ANY FREE COLORS THAT ARE LEFT OVER. A widget specifies a color for imaging by providing an index (pixel) into its associated palette. The bold part above is hard and would need to be done in the server."	other

First, I create the shared memory segment, attach the client,   attach the X server, and then remove (!) the segment. If you read the man   pages on removing of shared memory segments, you will see that the segment   only dies after all attachments are gone.   Now, if the client dies, that's one attachment gone (the OS cleans up for you)   and since the X server notices the client has dies, frees up it's resources,   including detaching from the segment: there goes the last attachment.

The IAEA has two conflicting goals.  One is to promote the spread of nuclear energy, the other to police its use.  Any successful policing, ie, finding cheaters, shows that its other arm is being overzealous in its promotion of nuclear energy. 	The IAEA announces in advance which sites it will visit.  It allows the country it is inspecting to veto areas on the list, by claiming they are not used for nuclear work.  Its inspectors are drawn from all over the world, and few have any experience in bomb building. Such experience would make the job of determining if a site was being used for military purposes much easier. 	Unfortunately, many countries object to knowledgeable inspectors, because the only really knowledgeable inspectors come from about 10 countries. 	There was an excelent article on the Feb 1 1993 New Yorker on why the IAEA fails to do its job.

In fact, it is the fact that hospitals frequently compete for physicians rather than for patients that (in part) complicates and undermines a simplistic free-market analysis of the market for medical care. >Hospitals tend to lose money on all sorts of high-tech, high-price >machinery. They manage to make it up on other charges. Once again, there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidney dialysis.  Although price controls have promoted an expansion of services to a much greater volume of patients, RD is still a profitable service. Otherwise, one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than the vast expansion that has occurred. > >> Remember, the notion that you can lose a little on each treatment but >> make it up in volume is not good economics even in a free market. :) > >Then how do you explain why grocery stores routinely offer an >array of products at prices below cost?  Are not grocery stores >embedded in a relatively free market? Can you spell ""loss leader?""  I knew you could.  Grocery stores do not attempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of it.  In fact, your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader for other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained. But the evidence does not support this contention.  Rather, it appears that price controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of service and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide comparable benefits.  Providers continue to profit from RD, they simply make less on each treatment than they would have if the price had risen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have. There is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD substantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday predictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restriction of service, lagging technological development, etc.  Likewise, it appears that in the VA and armed forces medical care systems, where providers are government agencies, some of these negative impacts may occur. (RD patients in the VA system in Spokane, for example, must travel to Seattle, 300 miles away, for treatment.) The bottom line, however, is that this is an example of government intervention (of a rather extreme sort) that appears to have had beneficial results for both providers and consumers.

EDT 	     Q	  Mr. President, what do you think of Jesse Jackson's protest today? 	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's an informational protest. I think it's fine.  The owners put out a statement few days ago, which they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase minority ownership and minority increases in management.  I think we should.  I'm encouraged by Don Baylor's appointment out in Colorado. And I think it's time to make a move on that front.  So, I think it's a legitimate issue, and I think it's -- like I said, it's an informational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to the game.  So, I think it's good. 	     Q	  Do you think they're moving fast enough? 	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that it was a good first step.  And I think you'll see some movement now.  And I think it's an issue that deserves some attention, and they're obviously going to give it some.  And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will highlight the issue.  So I think it's fine. 	     Q	  Mr. President, how about the logjam in the Senate on the economic stimulus plan?  Do you think they'll be able to break that and get cloture? 	     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't know, we're working at it.  I mean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one of the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up.  They said, you know, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  In the Senate the majority does not rule.  It's not like the country.  It's not like the -- it's not like the House.  If the minority chooses, they can stop majority rule.  And that's what they're doing.  There are a lot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote for the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political pressure not to do it. 	     And, of course, what it means is that in this time when no new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an economic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're willing to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston and Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.  It's very sad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in a hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans had always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the program were people like me who were out there at the grassroots level, governors and senators.  I just think it's real sad that they have chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep Americans out of work.  I think it's a mistake.

Judging from past experience (the '87 March, a Peace and Justice March the same year, and 3 different Pro-coice Marches), The Park Service will come out with an estimate that is approximately 1/2 the estimate that organizers will come up with - though the last Choice march I went to had a sign-in system, and the numbers ended up closer.

At the end of the class, you sign an informed consent waiver acknowledging that you've been told that drugs are bad for you, but you want them anyway. In doing so, you giver up ANY right to state-paid medical care for whatever might happen to you as a result of doing drugs, or any right to collect welfare or unemployment should you lose your job as a result of using drugs. You'd also give up your right to drive a car.

You seem to be saying that a LIMITED government will provide MORE opportunities for private interests to use it to pursue their own agendas, and asking libertarians to prove that this will NOT happen. While I can't offer such a proof, it seems pretty damn plausible that if the government does not regulate a particular area, it cannot become a tool of private interests to pursue their own agendas in that area. I rather suspect that it's the sort of government we have NOW that is more likely to become such a tool, and that it IS such a tool in many instances. >Just >as Marxism ""fails"" to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and >the state is to ""wither away,"" libertarians frequently fail to show how >weakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human >condition.

A better one might be the July 1st polls conducted for Macleans (our major English newsmagazine) by Decima Research ... Decima president Allen Gregg is considered one of the world's top poll researchers, and Mulroney's Conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in the face of impossible election situations.  I haven't had a chance to see this year's version due to our library, but previous ones before the Americans started their assault and disinformation had shown satisfaction at 97% and switching to an American all-private system had support within statistical noise.  The Decima polls are considered definitive.  Even the new Reform Party, a breakoff of traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly ""libertarian"" faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American counterparts on issues like these). Personally, I feel that the universal health insurance approach used in Canada, France and Germany -- paying to private health providers in a nominally free market not unlike America's, minus HMO's -- depends a lot on values in those societies different from the U.S.  The basic health needs for life are not viewed as market, but the insurance does allow the market to address that -- basic health care is not viewed on the level of ownership of a VCR as Americans would see it.

At    least one history I have read formed the opinion that they left for the    US not to practice religious freedom but to practice religious intolerance. Sigh, see what our school systems are producing?  Total confusion! The original English settlers were, probably, the most intolerant lot of people to ever assemble.  However, the Founding Fathers (Washington, Jefferson, Madison, etc.), practically made it their life's work to ensure that religious intolerance would not destroy their great experiment... a democratic republic. I strongly suggest that those interested get some of Jefferson's and Madison's writings. Particularly good is Madison's ""(something)and Remonstrance"", [yea, I'm litterate and have functioning memory cells :-( ].  IMHO, Jefferson and Madison were the two greatest American's who ever lived. Although both were products of their time (Jefferson was a slave owner), they were able to see more clearly than their contemporaries, and for that matter, more clearly than most modern politicians. Their prose is the epitome of eloquence. I don't know about y'all, but reading the Declaration of Independence give me mental goosebumps. (For those who have never read it, I am appending a copy of it.) -- In CONGRESS, July 4, 1776 The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.  That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.  That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.  Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.  But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.  The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.  To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained, and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them. He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within. He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands. He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers. He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance. He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies, without the consent of our legislatures. He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation: For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us: For protecting them by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders     which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States: For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world: For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent: For depriving us in many cases of the benefits of Trial by Jury: For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences: For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring     Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and     enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example     and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into     these Colonies: For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and     altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested     with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever. He has abdicated Government here by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands. He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions. In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms.  Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury.  A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature     to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and     settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity,     and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow     these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections     and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice     and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our     Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies     in War, in Peace Friends. We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by the authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare.  That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.  And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.

Part of what started this was my earlier example of Illinois, USA requiring anyone doing more than X automobile transfers a year (X = 10, I think) to become licensed as a used car dealer.  In addition, it requirs anyone with a used car dealer's license to own at least 10 cars at a time, all the time. Let me continue with this example and try to answer Steve's questions. Steve, let's say you have the talent and inclination to fix up and resell cars.  Either you've gotten good enough at it in your spare time to bump up against these limits, or you would like to do it full-time but these stupid, arbitrary laws prevent you from starting out small and pulling yourself up.  So I'm protected from a hungry neighborhood competitor willing to take a low profit while working extra hard to fulfill my needs, and you're protected from doing what you want with your life. Here's what I see libertarianism offering you: Your money is truly yours; it belongs to you.  You can use it to buy a car. If you use it to buy a car, it is truly your car; it belongs to you.  You can use your money to fix up that car.  Since it is your car, you can sell that car. Your life is truly yours; it belongs to you.  It matters not if someone thinks that it's ""wrong"" for you to buy and sell 10 cars within 12 months rather than, say, 9 cars.  They may dissaprove, but it is not their life or their money, it is your life and your money. My money is truly mine; it belongs to me.  I can use it to buy a car. Perhaps your car.  Perhaps that 10th car, the one that someone, somewhere dissaproves of you selling and, presumably, of me buying. That someone could go to the government and insist that the government make us stop it.  But the government would be powerless to stop us from doing what we like with our own property, in the abscence of fraud or agression. And it would be powerless to stop us from associating with each other. This does not seem to me to be a utopian dream, but basic human decency and common sense.  A real grass-roots example of freedom and liberty. And yes, not having a few people acting as our masters, approving or rejecting each of our basic transactions with each other, does strike me as a wonderful way to improve the human condition.    Thanks awfully,              Patrick"	other

Somebody correct (flame) me please! I *cannot* *believe* I am posting in this thread, but what the hell, he asked for it. I had sort of the same reaction myself when I was first realizing I was bi.  ""So what, >90% of everyone else is straight, I'd never end up with a guy anyway.""  As several people on soc.bi pointed out to me, this is true only if you find partners (for relationships or just for sex) in primarily straight circles.  Nowadays with gay culture quite visible in major cities and such, you can easily find yourself in an overwhelmingly queer social circle if you so choose.  (About half my friends are bi, and that's just from hanging out in the science fiction club and going to UCBU once a week, it's not as if I have to go out of my way and hang out in bars or something.) So the available pool for dates can be the same size.  Unless of course you're trying to date a random sample of the US population. As for promiscuity, I've traded email with Clayton on the topic, and he still doesn't seem to want to admit that yes, gay males are sometimes forced to resort to anonymous sex because they're closeted and can't afford to be seen in a permanent relationship. Or that part of the promiscuity is because of the messed-up gender roles in our society, and when males are dating males and they've *all* been trained to be the aggressor in sex, there's going to be more sex.  Or that what's ""dysfunctional"", what's ""screwed up"" is societal attitudes, not gay sexuality, and that's what encourages deviant behavior in gay males. (also note that just because someone's had 200 sex partners doesn't mean they're promiscuous.  yes, it sounds ridiculous, but it's quite possible for someone to go through a heavily closeted phase in which they have lots of anonymous sex with strangers, and then come out, start forming real relationships, and be monogamous or nearly so...) --                                                                       ____ Alan Jaffray (jaffray@math.uchicago.edu)  Email, 'talk' always welcome.  \bi/ Those who dance are thought mad by those who hear not the music -- Anon   \/ B0H7f-t+w-cg+(+)k+?s-vm-h-pS6/3bgz-++o-x-v+j+N0178l--+a(+)f-vn-(++)e--+dvb+u+"	other

Well, I don't think your query was exactly polite, but I will TRY to give you a polite responce.  Something atypical of the net, but here it goes.        Black is a descriptive adjective that describes Mr. King.  From many of the newspaper, radio, and tv news reports I have seen, this adjective is commonly in front of his name.  I have NEVER seen anyone complain about the use of this adjective when used in a benign manner.  I did not say that Mr. King was a no good black!  I do not know Mr. King and would not make this ascertian without some evidence to this effect.  I used it PURELY as a descriptive adjective in the same manner than many ( most ) news people have used it in the past.       The entire second trial was about race, Ted.  I don't feel compelled to discuss Mr. King's racial background, but had Mr. King been white there would not have been a second trial.  You probably are saying that the beating would not have occurred if he were white, but that is an extremely difficult call to make.  It is possible the case, but not definately.       I still think your actions are crap, Ted.  They are far more divisive than me using the adjective 'black' in a non-derogenory manner.  Would you have been happier if I had used 'African-american' ?  If so, then you really are lost in the world of PC.  You have already been instrumental in getting one persons net access revoked, and I wonder if you have sent a copy of my message to my sys admin with a plea that I am not worthy of posting.      The way you went about this 'polite' inquiry makes me believe it was anything but."	other

The American Indians had no concept of ownership of property, and often freely gave of their supplies to neighboring tribes, trading food and clothing for weapons or services.  The Native Hawaiians, like their Polynesian ancestors, also could not conceive of that idea, and shared many things with the other Islanders.  In fact, ""hi'ipoi"", the Hawaiian word for ""cherish"" means ""sharing food"".  The Great Mahele, in which the Islands were divided up more-or-less evenly between the rich and the poor, was a white man's idea.  In Africa, villagers will often share tools, crops, and clothing with other members of their own village and neighboring villages.  Every anthropologist who has ever been to Africa has at least one tale of the difficulties arising from the so- called ""theft"" of the scientists possessions -- two concepts of which, until the visitors came along, the natives had no understanding. These are the people we call ""savages"". On the other hand, car-jackings and muggings are up from last year.

As you're no doubt aware, Phill, there are probably five or six different, mutually contradictory versions of the events in Waco on Feb. 28 all of which are from reputable news sources, ranging the the Associated Press to TIME to Newsweek.         Some of the earliest reports issued by the AP were not at all flattering the to BATF, and produced some question as to who fired first.         Now, for all I know, you were there to witness it.  But I kind of doubt that. >Any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare >a private state has drifted into anarchy.

They set out to obtain a legal warrant and >attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang >the doorbell.         The BATF, in a letter they've been sending out to people, says both that they were ambushed because they lost the element of surprise, and that they went up and knocked on the door and had it slammed in their faces.         It strikes *me* as kind of strange to rely on surprise to serve a warrant by knocking on the door.         There are at least questions that need to be answered. >The paranoid assertion that the BATF fired first in an unprovoked >assault assumes that the BATF were on a death wish.         This paranoid assertation was made by witnesses to the original assault who stated that the BATF initiated hostilities by throwing concussion grenades and reported by the Associated Press. >Had they >expected the B-D to be anything other than peacefull citizens who >would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up >in a tank and broken the door down on day one.         Phill, the BATF were in a firefight with the BD for *forty-five* minutes.  I find it hard to believe that if they were expecting peaceful citizens they *wouldn't* have shown up in live-stock trailers and would have retreated immediately.         If they *were* expecting peacful citizens, why show up with over a hundred officers, some of which clearly visible on video to be carrying sub-machineguns, and *3* National Guard Helicopters?

For example, Article IV: ""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated""; Article V: ""no person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment by a Grand Jury ...  nor shall any person ... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law""; Article VIII: ""excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted"". Now I've never heard that Constitutional rights apply only to citizens; aren't they meant to apply equally to all *persons* living in the U.S.? Whether slaves were considered ""not human"" I don't know, but it seems that a case could be made that they weren't treated as ""people"" as defined in the Bill of Rights. And since the nation is nominally based on the Declaration of Independence which states that ""all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness"", it would also seem that slaves would not follow under this definition of humanity. ----- Eric Smith erics@netcom.com erics@infoserv.com CI$: 70262,3610"	other

Oh great.   Today's headlines tell us that the Croatians and Bosnians are fighting   each other throughout central Bosnia, in battles that the UN describes   as ""out of control"" and atrocities being reported from both sides.   These people are crazy.   Right now the Serbians are Number One in violations of human rights   and general carnage but crazed violence in the Balkans is like the   car-rental business - if you're Number Two you just try harder.   The region doesn't need military aid; it needs psychiatric help!   We should bomb them with Thorazine and then air-drop several   regiments of psychotherapists.   There is no justification for US military involvement because there   is no reasonable, definable goal we can achieve militarily.  Sure,   if send in several divisions of mechanized infantry we can probably   stop the more egregious fighting; but only as long as we are willing   to stay in there and play policeman and get shot at.  The minute we   leave or turn our backs they'll be at each other's throats again.   BTW, with Bosnia's large Moslem population, why have nations like   Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Egypt, and others with either money   or strong military forces not spoken out more forcibly or offered   to help out Bosnia?   The Turkish ambassador has ocassionally said   a thing or two, but that's all; I see no great enthusism from any   of those places to get *their* hands dirty.    Why does the US always   get stuck with this stuff?   Besides, there's no case that can be made for US military involvement   there that doesn't apply equally well to, say, Liberia, Angola, or   (it appears with the Khmer Rouge's new campaign) Cambodia.

Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows.  Who would die for a lie?  Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing how his son-in-law made the sun stand still.  Call me a fool, but I believe he did make the sun stand still. Niether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example anyone who is drawn to the Mad Mahdi is obviously a fool, logical people see this right away. Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the real thing. -- Ron House.                 USQ (house@helios.usq.edu.au)  Toowoomba, Australia."	other

To say that feminism equals ""superiority"" over men is laughable as long as he doesn't then proceed to pick up a rifle and start to shoot women as a preemptive strike--- aka the Canada slaughter that occured a few years ago. But then, men killing women is nothing new. Islamic Fundamentalists just have a ""better"" excuse (Qu'ran).     from the Vancouver Sun, Thursday, October 4, 1990     by John Davidson, Canadian Press     MONTREAL-- Perhaps it's the letter to the five-year old     daughter that shocks the most.     ""I hope one day you will be old enough to understand what     happened to your parents,"" wrote Patrick Prevost. ""I loved     your mother with a passion that went as far as hatred.""     Police found the piece of paper near Prevost's body in his     apartment in northeast Montreal.     They say the 39-year-old mechanic committed suicide after     killing his wife, Jocelyne Parent, 31.     The couple had been separated for a month and the woman had     gone to his apartment to talk about getting some more money     for food. A violent quarrel broke out and Prevost attacked     his wife with a kitchen knife, cutting her throat, police said.     She was only the latest of 13 women slain by a husband or     lover in Quebec in the last five weeks.     Five children have also been slain as a result of the same     domestic ""battles.""     Last year in Quebec alone, 29 [women] were slain by their     husbands. That was more than one-third of such cases across     Canada, according to statistics from the Canadian Centre for     Justice. [rest of article ommited] Then to say that women are somehow ""better"" or ""should"" be the one to ""stay home"" and raise a child is also laughable. Women have traditionally done hard labor to support a family, often more than men in many cultures, throughout history. Seems to me it takes at least two adults to raise a child, and that BOTH should stay home to do so! --- Maximus 2.01wb"	other

All five schools of law (to the best of my knowledge) support the death sentence for apostasy WHEN it is accompanied by open, persistent, and aggravated hostility to Islam. Otherwise I agree, there is no legal support for punishment of disbelief. The Qur'an makes it clear that belief is a matter of conscience. Public or private disavowal of Islam or conversion to another faith is not punishable (there are some jurists who have gone against this trend and insisted that apostasy is punishable (even by death) - but historically they are the exception.

So, he read what he could find in Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic. ##What he found was that the problems didn't go away, they got worse. ##Then, he decided to see if other religions had the same problems. ##So, he picked up the Holy Qur'an (in French) and found similar prob- ##lems, but not as many.

He was unable ##to find a wealth of scientific statements in the Holy Qur'an, but, ##what he did find made sense with modern understanding.  So, he ##investigated the Traditions (the hadith) to see what they had to ##say about science.  they were filled with science problems; after ##all, they were contemporary narratives from a time which had, by ##pour standards, a primitive world view.

(if you do not open your mouth, then you don't put you foot into your mouth either).    But then if you say Quran does not talk much about science, then one can not make claims (like Bobby does) that you have great science in Quran.

If you're interested in a change, here's an idea. 	Do you believe in absolute morality? And do you have absolute knowledge? Mere mortal you? And if you claim that your God has absolute knowledge, then you have have absolute knowledge of that? 	If you read the Bible and claim that it is the Word of God, and in it is contained the absolute moral code you ascribe to, but the prophets, no matter how divinely inspired are not gods but mere fallable mortals, then how can you be absolutely sure that they having heard the Word of God, have got it right? Also, you read their words in translation which invariably introduces errors of nuance and usage, and then how do you know that you got the right message? I assert that you do not, and that you do not have absolute knowledge of anything, including absolute morals. 	The only way you can assert such things is through appeal to prejudice via appeal by force of authority through yourself or a group you have aligned yourself to. >If morals come from what is societally accepted, why follow that? 	Because social pressure is the most powerful force known to man. How can you disprove a contention that the richeousness of established religion is anything other than social convention? One way is to assert that there are moral universals. But that is not the same thing as asserting that these universials owe their origen to trancendance or the supernatural or to dieties. >What right do >we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally mandated morality? 	We expect empathy from our fellow man. We expect to raise each generation with values that we live by, those which assure that mistakes we have made are not repeated. Do you think that mere authority checks all tendancies which are disruptive of civilized life? I think not! In fact authority is power, and power corrupts. The most powerful tend to think that they are above the law that applies to everybody else. Religious authority, theocarcy, has not mitigated this any better than other power structures on this score and it seems that because there are no checks on power concentrated in clergy or nobility that the abuses recorded by history are greater. 	We live and teach morals by setting an example, starting in the home. This does not come from books or authority figures in soceity. If people are weak or confused at the present time it is not because the breakup of the family has been precipitated by some mysterious moral decidance that redidication to traditional formulas will repair. That is but magical and simplistic thinking. We need to look at forces in the way we live, even the good things that happen in our present culture, that are weakening the family as the primary means we have to teach children values. Of course people are trying to have the community do things that once were done in the family alone. This may not be as effective. We need to look at this. >Pardon the extremism, but couldn't I murder your ""brother"" and say > that I was >exercising my rights as I saw them, was doing what felt good, didn't want >anyone forcing their morality on me, or I don't follow your ""morality"" ? 	Laying down the law, and with teeth, doesn't stop the crazy man from murdering your brother despite the morality or the law. It may help you with dealing promptly with him after the fact, but it may not be very effective for preventing mental illness or cracy people from murduring. 	It is quite interesting how ineffective moral authoritarianism is in fact. It may work best in societies that are already sonmewhat isolated, that do not experience change, and have long standing traditions. In a basic way moral codes decrease the number of decisions people have to make everyday. In a real sense thay allow people to not have to think. That is OK when things are stable, but it becomes a problem when conditions change. This leads me to think that morals are not sumething fundemental, at least most of them, recalling that there are values all people seem to agree on, but mutate in response to outside political, economic, technical, and cultural influiences. 	Lately, I have come to regard people who speak like you with great suspicion, especially when they include the pharse ""for the children."". I think that such people are more of an imparative to want to  control what others do and think than other more nobil pursuits, such as of the truth. Bruce Salem"	other

Society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of society shares this blame.

Reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or not.

Yes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all possible information), we can't always determine the difference in our flawed system.  I think that our system is almost as good as possible, but it still isn't objectively perfect.  You see, it doesn't matter if we *know* it is fair or not.

Rarely are any widespread social phenomenon reducible to such a   simple premise.  If they were, psychology would be a hard science   with roughly the same mathematical soundness as physics.

No, but you would need a lot of background reading in sociology to get to a point where the discussion would be focused enough to be helpful. The interaction of values and behavior among people has been a major defining element of both psychology and sociology for a century now, and is the part of both disciplines (as social psychology) that strikes me as most relevant to the various naive arguments about morality on the net. An exceptionally good place to get a clear view of ""social norms"" in action is the ""micro"" sociology of Ervin Goffman.  There are some very good introductory essays (""Deference and Demeanor"" is a classic), as well as accessible books like _Interaction Ritual_.  More difficult and theoretical are some of his later books like _Frame Analysis_.  But even at his most academic, Goffman escapes the dreadful boredom and heavily jargon-laden theorizing that makes most standard sociology unreadable. Morality is essentially the playing out of individual goals and aims in the setting of their expectations of other people, and others' expectations of them.  This becomes ""systematized"" in a ""socially mandated"" way simply because otherwise we'd have to invent the entire context of interpersonal realtions with every single interaction -- and we engage in social inter- actions usually hundreds or thousands of times a day, so that a renego- tiation of human interaction each time is a pretty ridiculous notion. We simply learn it (most of it) early, along with language (which is one of the main exemplars.) -- Michael L.

Are there traditional 1) If the Ninja has adjustable suspension, adjust it to a stiffer setting so you don't bottom out in bumpy curves. 2) Tell her the 3 cardinal rules are: a) NEVER EVER EVER EVER put her feet down. Not when you stop at a STOP sign, not when she thinks you're gonna crash, never. Keep them on the pegs until you tell her to get off the bike. b) She is to hold onto your waist. She should hold on tightly enough that she won't slide off the bike if you twist the throttle a bit. And (added bonus for you here), she should keep as close to your butt as possible so quick stops don't make her slide into you and knock your balls up onto the gas tank. You decide how best to word this. c) Just stay perpendicular to the bike; straight up in the seat. Don't lean your body into curves, just go with the bike and stay perpendicular. Don't look over your shoulder.* 3) Remember at all times that you have a passenger on the back. That means don't pop the clutch, and try to corner and stop smoother than usual. Be aware that if you jump on the brake, you're going to have the equivalent of a 100 lb. dead weight crashing into you from behind, so be prepared for that. 4) Make sure she pisses before the ride even if she says she doesn't have to go. No anti-women stuff here; I have a tiny bladder myself. 5) Remind her to look around while you're riding. Point to things of interest. It makes the ride more enjoyable to her (she won't get so focused on just looking at the back of your helmet), and it gives her ample excuse to squeeze you to show she saw what you pointed at. * My wife and I tried the MSF-recommended ""look over the rider's shoulder in curves"" bit, and it just didn't work.

(BTW, as of a couple years ago, the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 750 GSX's and Ninjas). Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren't ripped off is that most people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer, or mail- order types. Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily by law-enforcement types, and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep them honest about acquiring parts. For Harleys and rice-rockets, you've got 2 different situations. There is a HUGE aftermarket in Harley parts, so a bike can be parted out fairly easily. Ditto the non-sport Japanese bikes, but the prices on the parts for these are not as high, comparatively. For the 'rockets', anytime a bike goes down, the plastic is usually cracked, and is expensive to replace. It's fairly easy, then, for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike, slap it on a bike in for repair, repaint it, and make a tidy profit. The other parts, more traceable, can be used, or discarded if they are too traceable.

Figure. >John Stafford   Sure you can do wheelies with a shaft drive bike. I had a BMW R100RS that was a wheelie monster! Of course it didn't have the initial power burst to just twist it into the air - I had to pop the clutch. I also had to replace front fork seals a few times as well. The fairing is a bit heavy to be slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all the time. But let me give you fair warning: I trashed the ring/pinion gear in the final drive of my K75 (I assume) doing wheelies. And this was NO cheap fix either!! There is some kind of ""slip"" device in the shaft to prevent IT from breaking. Unfortunately, it didn't save the gears!   On the topic of wheelies, the other day I saw a kid on a big Hurricane do a ""stoppy""(?), or rear wheelie. Man, he had the rear end on this bike up about 2 feet off the ground at a traffic light. I don't recommend these activities anymore (now that I'm an ""old guy"" with kids of my own) but it looked damn impressive!!   If you can't keep both tires on the ground, at least have 'em pointed in that direction! :-) Cheers, B**2"	other

OK (but I'm right!)  :^) >The official line here (though I do have my doubts about it) is that the >front brake is applied first, followed by the rear brake, the idea being >that you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place. If that's the ""official line"" taught in those rider education classes you were refering to, that also don't teach countersteering, I have to question the quality of the classes.  The ""official line"" in MSF curricula is as I described.  Maximum braking is achieved by applying both brakes equally, when the weight distribution is nominally even and both tires have equal normal forces, and easing off on the rear to prevent locking it, and increasing braking on the front, as more traction is available to the front due to increased normal force due to weight shift. The ""official line"" you have been taught seems ineffective on the face of it.  Applying the rear brake after the front is not taking advantage of all the traction available to the rear at time 0, and is halving the available braking power by using only the front at time 0. >>Saying, ""brake until the tire just begins to slide"" is next to useless >>advice to a newbie.  He has to go out and slide the tire to find out >>where that is!  It also gives him zero information from which to >>develop a braking technique that changes as the braking and >>corresponding weight shift develop. > >If you don't slide the tyre, you have no way of knowing whether you've >achieved maximum braking or not.

""Chirping"" the tire indicates impending lockup (on most surfaces), and serves as a good guide to newbies to indicate maximum braking.  I agree that totally locking the front occasionally makes one a better rider, but it is a manuver best saved for an experienced rider, unless you have one of those outrigger bikes like Code used to use. >In any case, for maximum braking, if (as I suggested) you aim to keep >both wheels just on the point of sliding, then you'll be doing >exactly as *you* suggest!! True, but from the point of view of how to best *teach* riding skills (which is how this discussion started), ""keep both wheels just on the point of sliding"" is nearly useless information.

I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, >even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved. I agree that the desire for beauty is valid, but I think your desire to impose your vision of beauty is not.  You mention the age-old desire to somehow get up there, but ignore the beauty of the actual achievment of that vision.  You mention the beauty of a very dark sky, not impeded by the effects of humans, but ignore the beauty of the as-dark-as-can-be sky that is only visible from space, a vision that we, or at least, our descendents, may one day be able to see, in part, because of efforts that others call ugly.  One day, I hope, humans will be able to look out, not upon half the heavens, with only nature-creted lights, but upon all of the heavens, with no lights.  If advertising in space can help us reach that goal, it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it, than the 'pristine' sky of yesteryear (or yester-century), which is totally unreachable.  One of the original conceptions of beauty in wetsern sculpture was a human form, in the effort of striving to reach a goal. I don't think there's any reason to believe that modernity has changed that, just because it has changed the way we strive. BTW, there are places that people haven't fouled.

I am puzzled by the term ""concept."" Drag free may already have been flown. It was the idea behind putting up a spacecraft that would more accurately respond to motions from the Earth's gravity field and ignore drag. It was proposed many years ago and involved a ball floating between sensors whose job it was to signal to little adjustment jets to keep the ball away from them. The ball itself would then be in a drag free condition and respond only to gravity anisotropies, whereas the spacecraft itself would be continuously adjusting its position to compensate for drag.

The NRL is building the spacecraft, designing the detailed mission and doing the integration and operations (with help from, JPL & Goddard & prob. some folks I have left out...don't be mad). I am on the TAMP (Trajectory Analysis & Mission Planning) team and am responsable for the IV&V of the traj that Goddard/CSC are designing. As for why SDIO is doing it, some of the reasons are:    1)  the safety constraints are too tight to try to run the LIDAR in LEO    2)  in LEO we don't get any new radiation data on the sensors, we will get        that data on our 9 passages through the Van Allen (sp?) Belts    3)  since we are going out there...why not piggy-back some general science    4)  the intercept problem is a lot easied over LONG distances and LONG times I am sure there are some things I have forgotten, and some I haven't been told but, those are the reasons we all talk about. --                                              Jim Blackshear                                              jib@bonnie.jsc.nasa.gov"	sci.space

Actually, Hiten wasn't originally intended to go into lunar orbit at all, so it indeed didn't have much fuel on hand.  The lunar-orbit mission was an afterthought, after Hagoromo (a tiny subsatellite deployed by Hiten during a lunar flyby) had a transmitter failure and its proper insertion into lunar orbit couldn't be positively confirmed. It should be noted that the technique does have disadvantages.  It takes a long time, and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit. If you want something useful like a low circular polar orbit, you do have to plan to expend a certain amount of fuel, although it is reduced from what you'd need for the brute-force approach. -- All work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology                     - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry"	sci.space

Massive amounts of regolith would have to be processed. This thread reminds me of Wingo's claims some time ago about the moon as a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn't content with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth's crust, average) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though the market price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound. This prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources. On the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; ""high-Ti"" basalts (Apollo 11 and 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but... terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in titanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, and sometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are *enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the world (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If even 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2 at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti basalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the ore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being mined today).

Matthew     Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on     Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material     posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp). US PLANETARY MISSIONS     MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)     MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed     minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground     stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the     onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in     the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the     Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed     to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a     transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted     from the expression ""R-dot-bar sub n"" (nth smoothed value of derivative     of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations     of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.     MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December     of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a     very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world     with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide     (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).     MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective     shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary     space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar     panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in     solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.     MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and     took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it     flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere     much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from     this preliminary scan that Mars was a ""dead"" world in both the     geological and biological sense.     MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that     planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information     that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times     that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface     of an ocean.     MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work     done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away     the concept of Mars as a ""dead"" planet, first made from the basic     measurements of MARINER 4.     MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket     launcher autopilot failed.     MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to     orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no     other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian     surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once     flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup     images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.     MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe     did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in     ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,     plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four     Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974     to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed     Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than     thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which     makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.     PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)     PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph     the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide     new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new     data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft     had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on     October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.     PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first     U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally     designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead     studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to     36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6     through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,     and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would     have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.     PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER     11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to     study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through     1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever     to do so.     PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER     12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made     the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus     2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere     in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the     atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the     surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day     probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before     its batteries failed.     RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)     RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They     were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems     left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.     RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an     instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the     launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.     RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the     camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.     RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but     suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,     the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.     RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost     all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon     and drifted off into solar orbit.     RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send     back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact     with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras     did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first     U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.     LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)     LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image     various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO     missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our     understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.     All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were     essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.     probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar     surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.     SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)     The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar     module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the     soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered     in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing     vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was     strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.     Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the     first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images     and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from     SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,     the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored     the Tycho crater region in 1968.     VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)     VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on     a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June     19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse     Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for     Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes     found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of     its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was     pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is     pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the     thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and     boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.     The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran     out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a     weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep     functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command     had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until     further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the     engineers' efforts through May of 1983.     An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the     Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the     lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,     D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until     it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.     VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit     on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in     Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its     sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording     one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in     1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut     down on April 12, 1980.     The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.     VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)     VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March     5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched     August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,     1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and     by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare     once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to     outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,     but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.     Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their     satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered     that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and     aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major     surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous     volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.     When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets     and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep     the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive     jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle     is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was     startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.     The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,     kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.     VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,     continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly     monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was     found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational     axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on     Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10     satellites and one more ring were discovered.     In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,     including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright     patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were     discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a     canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)     The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their     on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets     beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the     location of the heliopause. SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS     Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and     Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:     SOVIET LUNAR PROBES     LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first 	     craft in solar orbit.

VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with 	       VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in 	       February of 1966. No images were returned.     VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface. 	       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe 	       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.     VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending 	       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before 	       reaching surface in 1967.

MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian 	     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red 	     Planet in 1971.     MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander 	     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.     MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to 	     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.     MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in 	     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S. 	     probe MARINER 9.     MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.     MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit 	     with its flyby bus.     PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest 	       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to 	       human/computer error.     PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did 	       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week 	       before scheduled Phobos landing.     While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even     interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have     yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,     Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a     Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been     planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now     the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their     space program remains to be seen. JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS     SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on     January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km     on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to     measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of     which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on     January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest     approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The     geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for     a Japanese spacecraft.     During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail     passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby     will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third     October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).     HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,     1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten     once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first     lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget     satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to     orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.     The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An     apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists     to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March     19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The     rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt     camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.     Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and     performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten     made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,     1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and     fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into     lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the     approach: 	Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km 	Periapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km 	Inclination	: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane) 	Period		: 4.7 days PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES     I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three     groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,     and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means     complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your     research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can     add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.     Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it     would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in     order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in     this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date     general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra     background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good     public and university library. Some of the more recently published works     can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market     bookstore.     General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):       J.

Other works and periodicals:     NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space     probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry     these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission     you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study     some of the books listed above.     Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL     GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's     Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,     SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER     missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the     VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.     More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions     can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and     SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major     newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,     but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events     were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are     affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you     probably know.     Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you     might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space     groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their     periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe     missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,     Pasadena, California 91106 USA.     Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I     personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas     in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from     it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

Recognizing that most of the military requirements for launch vehicles are pulled out of a hat somewhere (say, has the shuttle ever really used that 1200mi crossrange capability?  You get the idea, figure out how many, how often, where to, etc...) Then taking this data, and forming a sematech type company (bad example, I know... but at least its an example...)  To develop between 3 and 5 craft designs.  Then to take all of those designs, and figure out EXACTLY what the technologies are, and demonstrate those technologies, in order to eliminate designs that can't be built today.  And lets say that this portion again funded by the GOV cost about $20 million. And from here all of these companies went their separate ways, with the intention of taking all of the market data and the design data to wall street, and saying ""I want to build this vehicle, and here are the numbers that show %20 ROI, fund me...) Now many of you think that this is a joke, but I have it on good authority that just this project is shaping up in the background. It seems that the aerospace companies have learned that everyone yelling similar but different things ends up in many programs that do nothing much and get canceled (NASP, NLS, ALS, DCY?, etc...)  They need to work more in the japaneese, and european spirit of initial cooperation.  They have also learned that design requirements that are phony (I.E. some generals idea of what a space vehicle ought to be) ends up getting chopped up in congress, because it is not a REAL requirement.

I haven't seen any speculation about it. But, the Salyut KB (Design Bureau) was planning a new LH/LOX second stage for the Proton which would boost payload to LEO from about 21000 to 31500 kg. (Geostationary goes from 2600 kg. (Gals launcher version) to 6000 kg.. This scheme was competing with the Energia-M last year and I haven't heard which won, except now I recently read that the Central Specialized KB was working on the successor to the Soyuz booster which must be the Energia-M. So the early results are Energia-M won, but this is a guess, nothing is very clear in Russia. I'm sure if Salyut KB gets funds from someone they will continue their development. The Centaur for the Altas is about 3 meters dia. and the Proton is 4 so that's a good fit for their existing upper stage, the Block-D which sets inside a shround just under 4 meters dia. I don't know about launch loads, etc.. but since the Centaur survives Titan launches which are probably worse than the Proton (those Titan SRB's probably shake things up pretty good) it seems feasible. EXCEPT, the Centaur is a very fragile thing and may require integration on the pad which is not available now. Protons are assembled and transported horizontially. Does anyone know how much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support while bolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track and erected on the pad? They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads (unless the new Proton second stage is actually built), and of course any Centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from the US at great cost. These systems may viloate US law so there are political problems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the CIS you mention.

The meetings were part of ""Space VLBI Week"" held at JPL in early March and were intended to maintain cooperation between international space agencies participating in the development of the U.S. Space VLBI Project, a recently approved JPL flight project set for launch in 1995.      U.S. Space VLBI will utilize two Earth-orbiting spacecraft -- the Japanese VSOP (VLBI Space Observing Program) satellite with its 8-meter radio telescope, and a Russian RADIOASTRON 10-meter satellite. Both spacecraft will team up with ground-based radio telescopes located around the world to create a radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radio telescope observing power by a factor of 10.      Japan's VSOP satellite will use a limited six-hour orbit to conduct imaging science, while the Russian RADIOASTRON spacecraft will exploit a larger, 28-hour Earth orbit to conduct exploratory radio astronomy. Each satellite will point at a source target for roughly 24 hours, while approximately 20 ground-based radio telescopes will simultaneously point at the same source object while within view on Earth.      According to Dr. Joel Smith, JPL's project manager for the U.S. Space VLBI, meetings like those held at JPL will permit Japan and Russia, who have little previous experience in radio interferometry, to establish working relationships with the radio astronomy communities that will be vital during the complex observations required by the Space VLBI project.      ""One of our main activities is developing the methodology for international coordination, because the two spacecraft simultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations while using the ground-based radio telescopes to observe the same celestial objects,"" said Smith.      Three new tracking antennas are being built at DSN facilities and other three other tracking facilities located in Japan, Russia and Green Bank, W.Va. This global network of ground-based radio telescopes will use precision clocks and high-speed recorders to collect observation data and forward the information to a correlator located at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M. The correlator will combine and process data, then make it available to mission investigators in Moscow, Tokyo, and JPL via electronic mail.      Smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope created by the Space VLBI network will provide radio astronomers with better resolution than has ever been achieved before by ground-based radio telescopes, allowing astronomers to take a closer look at distant objects in space.      ""There is a long history of radio astronomy using ground-based telescopes,"" said Smith. ""What we intend to do is to extend radio astronomy into Earth orbit. Our goal is to look deeper into the cores of galactic nuclei, quasars and other active radio sources to understand what drives those things we have seen so far with radio astronomy.""      Smith noted that if one examines ""the active galactic nuclei, you'll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater than light, and at energy levels that are millions of times greater than you would expect.""      He said some astronomers believe that black holes may be located in the cores of these galaxies, and that they may fuel the jets. Smith hopes that ""by using Space VLBI to look further into the cores, this theory may be supported or disproved.""      Russian space-flight hardware, including transponders and transmitters, are now being tested in the United States, and Japanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later this year. Analysis of this hardware will permit U.S. scientists and engineers to understand how to modify the high-speed VLBA Correlator operating at the NRAO in order to accommodate the odd data patterns that will originate from the more than 20 ground-based radio telescopes involved in Space VLBI.      Smith is particularly pleased that meetings with the Japanese and Russian space agency officials -- like those held at JPL in March -- have proceeded smoothly. Yet he knows that the political uncertainty in Russia could jeopardize that country's participation in the project.      ""Nothing is ever smooth,"" he said, ""but the Russians have been incredibly open with us. We always anticipated some likelihood that we will not succeed because of political factors beyond our control, yet there tends to be a way of keeping these things going, because scientists on both sides are trying hard, and people recognize the value of cooperation at this level.""      Smith points out that the Japanese space agency has more at stake than just fulfilling an international commitment to a science mission.      ""The Japanese have been extremely cooperative, since international cooperation is essential to their science mission,"" he said.      But Smith also noted that Japanese space agency officials look at the U.S. Space VLBI mission as an opportunity to showcase the technology involved with VSOP spacecraft, and their highly regarded Mach V launch vehicle.      Yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such an ambitious project, JPL's Smith is satisfied that planning for the Space VLBI Project is beyond the significant financial and political hurdles that otherwise might threaten the project.      ""Fortunately, we have the virtue of having two partners, and if either falls out, we would still have something with the other.

It appears to be induced partly to physical discomfort and part to mental distress.  Some people are more prone to it than others, like some people are more prone to get sick on a roller coaster ride than others.  The mental part is usually induced by a lack of clear indication of which way is up or down, ie: the Shuttle is normally oriented with its cargo bay pointed towards Earth, so the Earth (or ground) is ""above"" the head of the astronauts.

This effort will:   o   Use the evolving infrastructure of the U.S. Global Change Research       Program including the Mission To Planet Earth (MTPE) and the Earth       Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Programs.   o   Use the Internet, particularly the High Performance Computing and       Communications Program's NREN (National Research and Education       Network), as a means of providing access to and distribution of       science data and images and value added products.   o   Provide broad access to and utilization of remotely sensed images in       cooperation with other agencies (especially NOAA, EPA, DOE, DEd,       DOI/USGS, and USDA).   o   Support remote sensing image and data users and development       communities. The user and development communities to be included (but not limited to) as part of this effort are educators, commercial application developers (e.g., television weather forecasters), librarians, publishers, agriculture specialists, transportation, forestry, state and local government planners, and aqua business. This program will be initiated in 1994.  Your assistance is requested to identify potential applications of remote sensing images and data.  We would like your ideas for potential application areas to assist with development of the Implementation Plan. PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. We are seeking your ideas in these areas:   (1)  Potential commercial use of remote sensing data and images;   (2)  Potential noncommercial use of remote sensing data and images in        education (especially levels K-12) and other noncommercial areas;   (3)  Types of on-line capabilities and protocols to make the data more        accessible;   (4)  Additional points of contacts for ideas; and   (5)  Addresses and names  from whom to request proposals.

I think had NASA  locked onto this design, back in 1984,  with scarring to support a TRUSS for real expandability,  we'd be looking at a flying space station. This looks the most realistic, to me,  IMHO,  but,  i dont know if there is enough will power  to toss the CDR'd  existing hardware and then  take a 1/3rd  power cut  and do it this way. the core  launch station has a lot of positive ideas.

From the description of ad here, it sounds like they're talking about ""High Power Rocketry"", an outgrowth of model rocketry.  This hobby uses non-metallic structural compoments and commerically manufactured engines ranging in impulse classification from G to P.  The hobby has been flourishing from early 1980s and is becoming increasing popular. Technically this is not consider amateur rocketry. Any rocket with a liftoff weight greater than 3.3 pounds OR using a total impulse of G or greater, REQUIRES an FAA waiver to launch. Typically, a group of people get an FAA waiver for specified period of time (ie week, weekend, etc.) at a designated site and time, and all of the launches are then covered under this ""blanket waiver"". There is also a ""High Power Safety Code"" which designates more specific rules such as launch field size, etc. Finally, in order to purchase any of the larger (Class B) rocket motors you need to certified through either the National Association of Rocketry or Tripoli Rocketry Association. Certification procedures require a demonstarted handling and ""safe"" flight at a total impulse level. For more information, watch rec.models.rockets newsgroup. R.

Henry, if I read you correctly, you may be asking ""If I put a blackbody in interstellar space ('disregarding the Sun and nearby large warm objects'), what termperature will it reach in thermal equilibrium with the ambient radiation field?""    If that's the case, let me point out that interstellar dust and molecules provide many instances of things that are, well, not-too-far from being blackbodies.  Many different observations, including IRAS and COBE, have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures can range from 40K to 150K.  You might look in a conference proceedings ""Interstellar Processes"", ed. D. J. Hollenbach and H. A. Thronson, Jr., published in 1987.  Try the articles by Tielens et al., Seab, and Black.    Inside the disk of the galaxy, the temperature varies quite a bit from place to place (how close are you to the nearest OB association, I would guess).  Outside the galaxy, of course, things aren't so varied.

My information shows that the last San Marco launch was 1988.  There seem to have been a total of seven before that.  I seem to recall that someone, either ASI or the University of Rome (?) includes money in their annual budget for maintainance of the platforms (there are actually two).

Seems like a lot of trouble to go to. Its probably better to invest in newer launch systems. I don't think a big cost advantage for using Russian systems will last for very long (maybe a few years). Lockheed would be the place to ask, since you would probably have to buy the Proton from them (they market the Proton world wide except Russia). They should know a lot about the possibilities, I haven't heard them propose US launches, so I assume they looked into it and found it unprofitable. >Now if it uses storables, Yes... >then  how long would it take for the russians >to equip something at cape york? Comparable to the Zenit I suppose, but since it looks like nothing will be built there, you might just as well pick any spot. The message is: to launch now while its cheap and while Russia and Kazakstan are still cooperating. Later, the story may be different.

The Centaur that is being built for T4 would be a better bet to integrate onto the Proton as the T4/Centaur is designed for the Extremely Harsh envorinment of the T4 launch. It is also closer to 4 m in diameter. You've hit on the real kicker, however. The Centaur is pressure stabilized. It cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks. Additionally, the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+/- 5 psi. That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions (when I was there 88-91) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make a non-pressure stabilized centaur. The answer -- a centaur not worth launching. The Atlas/Centaur does not require on-pad integration, however the T4/Centaur does. I believe the on-pad integration is to a great extent due to the cleanliness requirements and PFL configuration, so maybe something can be done there........ |> |> They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads |> (unless the new Proton second stage is actually built), and of course |> any Centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from the |> US at great cost.

The addition of LOX/LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it lifts off. A LHe facility is also needed. I don't know what the proton uses for fuel, but since they are derived from ICBM's I would suspect that they use storable propellants which don't have the ullage problem that cryo's do. If there is no cryo at the sight at all, the addition of these systems could be big $$, not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with providing centaur GSE to Russia. That issue alone might be enough to kill this idea. -- H.D.

This is a common misconception.  There was nothing ""off the wall"" about the Wright Brothers.  They were in correspondance with a number of other experimenters (Octave Chanute, Lillienthal, etc), they flew models, they had a wind tunnel.  In short, they were quite mainstream and were not regarded as odd or eccentric by the community. I suggest you read The Bishop's Boys or the biography by Harry Gates? Combs?  (I can never remember which it is--the guy that had the FBOs and owned Learjet for a while).  These are both in print and easily obtainable.  The Bishop's Boys is in trade paperback, even. Even better would be the multi-volume set of the Wrights' writings, but this is out of print, rare, and hideously expensive. -- Mary Shafer  DoD #0362 KotFR NASA Dryden Flight Research Facility, Edwards, CA shafer@rigel.dfrf.nasa.gov                    Of course I don't speak for NASA  ""A MiG at your six is better than no MiG at all.""
