They are extremely useful mathematical models to describe physical observations we can make. Other posters have aptly explained the atomic model.  Gravity, too, is very much a theory; no gravity waves have even been detected, but we have a very useful model that describes much of the behavior on objects by this thing we _call_ gravity.  Gravity, however, is _not_ a fact.  It is a theoretical model used to talk about how objects behave in our physical environment.  Newton thought gravity was a simple vector force; Einstein a wave. Both are very useful models that have no religious overtones or requirements of faith, unless of course you want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly the way the theory now formulated talks about it.  That takes a great leap of faith, which, of course, is what religion takes.

But once you make a decision on the value of truth, and the likelihood of science getting it, the rest follows.  In your example, science is necessarily worthless, and so are its results, because truth is worthless, assuming that's all science is good for.

But I don't use it in the second sense.  Consider that F=ma is no different than F=$3 until I note the connection with reality that F=ma has, and F=$3 does not.  I'm making a decision as to the importance of F=ma over other expressions I can compute.  I'm valuing it, whether implicitly or directly, because I'm saying that things that have a basis in reality are different to other things which do not.  And _no-one_ points out an _unimportant_ difference, _except_ to say that it's unimportant.

No, actually organic chemists were among the first chemists to use modern MO theories for explaining reactions that did not fit into the old models. In synthetic organic chemistry, which still comprises a large part of organic chemistry, it is indeed common to ignore the rest of the molecule and pay attention only to the functional groups, but I think this, too, has changed with the advent of molecular modelling and asymmetric synthesis.

So this abortion-rejecting health-care market might be much smaller than one would think. 	But never underestimate the willingness of some professed opponents of abortion to get them. 	""If you are against abortion, DON'T HAVE ONE!"" 	goes one pro-choice slogan I once saw on someone's car (or was it a pickup truck?). I had been following an old railroad line that is to be used for a BART extension in South San Francisco, and I saw this car with this bumper sticker along the way. >As for someone suggesting that ""no one would be upset if I were >to give money to support women with crisis pregnancies, etc""  But >I have, having initiated and supported an ad in USC's student >newspaper regarding a Catholic health clinic offering assistance >to women in crisis pregnancies.  I've also devoted my life to a >consistent life ethic.

What have you done folks? 	Operation Rescue? Dennis Kriz, be aware of some of the company you keep. I'm talking about seriously militaristic right-wingers who would _love_ to execute those who provide and get abortions. Although there has been only one such assassination so far, I wonder how many other opponents of abortion would be willing to perform such assassinations if they could get away with it. -- /Loren Petrich, the Master Blaster /lip@s1.gov"	other

Since He will speak to those who have thought, surely He will speak to humankind, whose make-up and awareness are more comprehensive of all conscious beings.  Since He will speak to humankind, surely He will speak to the most perfect of mankind and those most worthy of address and highest in morality, and who are qualified to guide humanity; then He will certainly speak to Muhammad (SAW), who, as friend and foe alike testify, is of the highest character and morality, and who is obeyed by one fifth of humanity, to whose spiritual rule half of the globe has submitted, with the radiance of whose light has been illumined the future of mankind for thirteen centuries, to whom the believers, the luminous segment of humanity, renew their oath of allegiance five times a day, for whose happiness and peace they pray, for whom they call down Allah's blessings and bear admiration and love in their hearts.    Certainly, He will speak to Muhammad (SAW), and Indeed He has done so;  He will make him the Messenger, and Indeed He has done so; He will make him the guide for the rest of humanity, and Indeed He has done so. ----------------------------------------------------------------- To be continued In$a Allah.

Even if the readers have the slightest idea as to what the writer is referring to, it should be incumbent on Mr. Erwin to back up what he says with at least a concrete example of perhaps even a reference or two. (For example, ""Simon Zealotes"" = the certain apostle having a nickname connected to a Jewish terrorist group) 	Even Josephus fails to make the kind of broad brush reference to Christians made above - he is quite silent as to the fate of the Jewish Christian Church in Jerusalem, even though he took the time to record the death of St. James (brother of St. John). On the subject of the fate of Jesus's family, including James (the brother of Jesus) we learn nothing from Josephus. 	Likewise, Tacitus condemns the Jews as being a particularly vicious people, getting many of the facts about Jewish history wrong in the process. But even though Tactitus undoubtedly had the opportunity to learn much about the Christians during his tour in Asia Minor under Domitian, we find little to enlighten ourselves about the Christians in either the _Histories_ or the _Annals_ 	The writer's interpretation of _Acts_ is purely subjective as stated, and so one might expect him to elaborate a bit on just what aspects of ""cult psychology"" are to be found there. I can think of a thing or two offhand, but I'd like to give Mr. Erwin the opportunity to demonstrate his own knowledge satisfactorily before throwing out any more hints.

Unfortunately, he seems to be hoping for simplicity where it is not available. The lukewarm stew he detects may well be an inevitable result of the divine mixing himself up with a bunch of losers such as humanity. Also unfortunately (perhaps) I have a deadline in two weeks, the responsibility for which prevents me, in good conscience, from writing a more considered response and fully entering the fray, as it were. Let me then say what I can, briefly. ----- >The two commandments *are* rules; they are merely rules that are >so vague that they are practically devoid of meaning. This point, for the net.browsers who also still read books, is pursued throughly in Kaufmann, Critique_of_Religion_and_Philosophy. >The commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed, >in part, as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as if >he has ""ultimate responsibility."" This is a theological statement worthy of Barth. Dr Turpin (DD) may wear the black robe of Geneva yet! :-) >Indeed, many traditions present >an interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret >loving one's neighbor as following various other rules, and >relying on their god to make things come out right, precisely >because it would be wrong for man to assume such ""ultimate >responsibility."" Once again, we are confronted with good sounding >goo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean. This requires the assumption that all interpretations are equally valid, that there is no way of reasonably distinguishing among them. I wouldn't make that assumption; I don't think it is a reasonable assumption. >And who is to say that this interpretation is ""twisted""?  There >are many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward >reading show the Christian god behaving in just this way. Michael, and I, and others, read 'the Bible' with Christian glasses. Among the things that this should imply is that the NT informs the OT, even to the point of dominanting it. Some points in the OT (ceremonial & dietary laws) are explicitly abrogated by the NT texts. To drive Russell Turpin's point with adequacy, one needs to begin with NT texts (probably from Matthew, and probably about damnation) (Just trying to help :-) ) This part is, I discover, what most moves me to post: mls> I am a ""radical"" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously. >No, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel >seriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the >gospel. Russell Turpin's 'No' here is misplaced, not to say inappropriate. Michael's self-description much govern.  The equation of radical = liberal, which seems implied by Russell Turpin  is wrong.  Radical conservatives are possible (if sadly lacking in numbers at present).

Why don't I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me mls> tell you something about Christianity? ... Michael's question gets to a heart of the matter (Klingons have two hearts, so my metaphor is not mixed, just extraterrestrial :-) ) Russell Turpin (in an earlier post) had said that Michael (Michael's theological positions, actually) didn't tell him much about Christianity; Dean Simeon responds (this time gently): 'What do you mean?' More direct, perhaps, would have been: 'What could you possibly mean?' The implied rhetorical effort, to separate Michael from the tradition, is a failure. Michael is in the tradition. If your idea of the tradition doesn't include him, Change your idea of the tradition! >The irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per >se that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and >gays. How can one answer this while staying on the more general issue? I'm on the other side of the interpretive fence (from Michael) on this issue, yet '*nothing*' is a hideous overstatement. One verse is enough to refute it; I'll offer two, from Paul (of all people): 'In Jesus Christ there is neither male nor female...'(Galatians 3:28 {I don't quote single verses as a rule, and I don't carry them in my head}) and '*Nothing* shall separate us from the glory of God...' (roughly, from Romans). [If Russell would promise to convert based on these or any other verses,  I'd promise to get the full context for any that he requires :-) :-)] >In short, it is the extra-Christian principles that >make Michael's Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would >be as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by >Christian interpretation. This conclusion does not follow, even in short, from the argument that goes before. A surprising logical ellipsis.

I think that most see the benefit of a non- anarchistic system.  Our incredibly high standard of living is based on technology, derived from an ordered existance.  We wouln't have got far if we were still bashing each other over the head with clubs, right? The question becomes, is it possible to have an ordered society in which the laws are recognized to be in place based on _enlightened self interest_ as opposed to morality? And secondly, assuming a satisfactory _legal_ code is in place, and we choose to persue individual freedoms as far as possible, is a _moral code_ required or even acceptable? Can an agreement ever be reached?  At what point do we start to comprimise? Think about these questions in light of some recent social issues: 	Topic			Legal?		     Moral?

Robert Weiss writes [a promise from Psalm 9:10] >Gee, since you wouldn't be at all hypocritical, you must be really >busy arguing against these out-of-context extracted translations! He directed a similar accusation of hypocrisy, again based on a lack of response to an article by Robert Weiss, toward Stephen. I pointed out that I did, in fact, agree that both Robert Weiss and Jim Meritt took quotes out of context.  Hence, I find it difficult to understand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite.  Needless to say, I don't have time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m. that takes a quote out of context. I asked Jim the following: >}So, according to you, Jim, the only way to criticize one person for >}taking a quote out of context, without being a hypocrite, is to post a >}response to *every* person on t.r.m who takes a quote out of context? Jim replied by saying >Did I either ask or assert that? But today we find four articles from Jim, one of which has the subject ""Silence is concurrence"": m23364@mwunix.mitre.org (James Meritt) writes: >Is it not the case that, in the eyes of the law, when someone is aware of >something and has the capability of taking action and does not, that individual >may be held responsible for that action? Which is, of course, a complete red herring.  Taking quotes out of context isn't a crime.  I don't have time to read every article on t.r.m., and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all. Does ""silence is concurrence"" imply that Jim thinks that because I didn't respond to Weiss' articles I must condone Weiss' taking quotes out of context?  Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this question; read what he has written and decide for yourself. But back to the context of my conversation with Jim.  Jim's next gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he concluded that I was being a hypocrite.  I challenged him to provide the details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion. Today we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn't help make it more clear, Jim), titled ""Inductive Logic"": >Scenario: >A white goose waddles past the door >A white goose waddles past the door >A white goose waddles past the door >...( repeat an uncountably large number of times)... >A black goose waddles past the door.  An individual hits it with an axe. > >1. Given that the population of geese is uncountably large, and the size of the >   confidence interval for the decision is undetermined, under what conditions >   could a decision upon the behavior of the individual towards white geese >   be made? > >2. If ONLY black geese are observed to be axed, is it not a valid question >   to be concerned with the different behavior between black and white geese? More red herrings.  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large number of my articles?  Could Jim mean that because I ""axed"" his articles, but not Weiss' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ... Well, I can't see where he is going with this. But I can help him with his induction.  I've written roughly 80 articles since January.  The vast majority of them are discussions with Frank DeCenso and other inerrantists, where I take the position that they are making bad arguments.  Some are discussions with Jim Meritt where I take the position that he is making bad arguments (a straw man argument earlier, and taking quotes out of context more recently.) Think hard about this Jim.  See the pattern?  Think harder.  Run it through your induction engine and see what pops out. dj"	other

Traditional wisdom says you are almost certainly better off selling it yourself if you don't mind that extra hassle.  Having a trade-in on a purchase just makes getting the best price from a dealership more confusing. >i know that the ""blue book"" value for the car is $2825. I assume this is _retail_ bluebook.  There are two bluebook prices, one for retail and one for wholesale.  You really want the retail price if you can get it.  The blue books also have adjustments you can make for low mileage and extras on your particular car.  You should look all this stuff up yourself. Also keep in mind that the blue book prices are averages over the country that may not apply in your area.  For example, blue book prices are low for California.  A better way of finding out how much your car might be worth is to call around and see what it's selling for (if any used lots have one) or looking in local papers for similar cars and checking out the prices.  It might be more time efficient to take a small loss (rather than hold out for 6 months for the best price). >an acquaintence >has offered to give me blue book value for the car. I don't know what you mean by ""an acquaintance"" but I would make darn sure that I was paid, that is, cashier's check in full before delivery.  There's a real temptation when selling to a pseudo-friend to be more accomodating than you should.  Make sure you get the money and if they hedge about paying in full at the start (with a cashier's check or cash) then I would go elsewhere.  Rememeber that you can probably sell your car to a used car lot or wholesaler and get wholesale bluebook.  That's probably a safer approach than selling to a private party. -- -- Alan                        # Mountain Dew and doughnuts...    ..!ames!elroy!alan          # because breakfast is the most important meal    alan@elroy.jpl.nasa.gov     # of the day."	other

I asked for the same coverage and same deductibles. Most of the companies charge you according to your zip code. Others charge according to your city. Anyhow, I gave the same zip code and city to all three places. Here's what I found (for a '93 Integra GS): AAA: ~$2000/yr. State Farm: 2614.92/yr. Allstate: 1220/yr. AAA is non-profit, so they said I could also expect to receive about $200-300 back at the end of the year. Still, There is a huge gap between all of these companies. State Farm wants MORE than TWICE as much as Allstate. I think I should be suspicious, but I've never heard anybody else complain. Any comments? Thanks, Gregg L. Kasten gregg@cs.stanford.edu	other

The production was excellent. The appearance Antonio,you weren't alone. ABC ratings were very good. I was schocked to hear that ABC's telecast was the fifth most watched sporting event over the weekend. National rating came out to a very respectable 3.3. Top-29 Nielsen markets were at 2.9. In Boston,the game scored lower at 2.4 but it had some competion from local sports teams. Quite frankly, I expected ABC's ratings to be under 2.0. But I'm happy to be proven wrong! Well,well...Sometimes it pays off clicking away on your cable-tv remote control.:-) And if you happen to be a hockey fan,you could just stumble upon a playoff hockey game... ESPN picked up Detroit-Toronto game on Monday night because the only night game in MLB was being rained out in Chicago. You have to give ESPN credit for switching to Detroit's FOX-50 coverage and having Bill Clement at a Pittsburgh's TV station(WATE?) for intermission analysis. Maybe,ESPN people were giddy over perliminary over-night ABC ratings for Sunday's telecast and thought it was a good idea to feature the Norris division showdown rather than a monster truck competion. Good move,ESPN! -PPV Mark"	other

So there's a kind of nostagia for the old days, before expansion, the Soviet series, Gretzky and even Bobby Orr, when guys weren't afraid to take a hit, nobody floated and defensemen played defence. Who cares that that probably never really existed, the myth is still around in Canada and all the European in fluence on the game has diminished it in some people's eyes. Personally, I'd like to add before I get flamed, I love the fast-paced ""European"" game and think Don Cherry is a bit of an idiot.

I think that if each series goes its max I could be watching hockey playoffs for 40-some odd consecutive nights (I haven't counted so that's a pure guess). I have two tv's in my house, and I set them up side-by-side to watch MON-QUE and keep an eye on BOS-BUFF at the same time.  I did the same for the two afternoon games.

Their cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of 17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to the playoff-bound Blues. The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3. With the North Stars' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit playing. They held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer. Tampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating supervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired. ``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,"" Blues coach Bob Berry said. If the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues' disappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered Berry's anger. ``It wasn't pretty at the end,"" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as good as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but it did."" Still, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end. Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks in a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at Chicago Stadium. The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points, their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay, which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its first season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points. The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous Blues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment. ``It's a shame we let down,"" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score two goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others. ``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have ended 6-2 and everyone would be happy."" Instead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs. ``We won, and that's all that matters,"" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3 for the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play."" Some players didn't have a problem. ``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,"" said Rich Sutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You can't allow five goals like we did, that's not right. ``It was disappointing to see what was going on."" Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow, he missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss. ``I didn't know it was final,"" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the bench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs, and that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the end."" The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score showed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third period. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time. ``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,"" Berry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took."" If Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might bother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit. Until the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd going at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then, Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period. With the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period. Then, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone. Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the rebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend. Last year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form of cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23. ``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,"" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and I know he was watching. I know he's happy."" Miller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo at 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds later, making it 5-1. Less than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland scored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass from Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period. Then, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third period, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third period. The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the winner. ``We were in there,"" Shanahan said. ``The game was over.

Instead, it was 32k and it took at least a minute.  A complete waste of (my) time and bandwidth, as far as I'm concerned.

In that case the government will stomp on you - ask any radio ham!

I'm afraid this doesn't work either. We can pick up laptop screens without any problem. Most of the so-called `low radiation' monitors are also useless. The description turns out to a marketing assertion rather than an engineering one. We thought there might be a market for a monitor which was not as hugely expensive as the military Tempest kit, but which was well enough shielded to stop eavesdropping using available receivers. We built a prototype, it works, and it's still sitting on my lab bench. Commercial interest was exactly zero. In the absence of open standards, a monitor which really is `low radiation' (and costs 500 dollars more) can't compete against a monitor which just claims to be `low radiation' (and whose only extra cost of production is the pretty blue sticker on the box).

I think the AD21020 should have enough juice for this (50MIPS). As part of the project I'm working on now, we're trying to get CELP up and running in realtime full duplex mode...

These quotes bother me in three ways. (1) Many people will read and remember that ``encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement.'' (2) The Administration is explicitly failing to acknowledge that every American is entitled to use strong encryption to ensure his own privacy. (3) The President, by implication, may intend to outlaw any cryptographic devices which ensure privacy but do not have a key-escrow system. I want to see an organization which will combat such statements. Encryption does _not_ threaten the public safety, any more than ski masks do.

Just for the hell of it, let's destroy this remark. Let us imagine that the executive branch actually could extract keys from the escrow houses without anyone knowing, or telling. Now what? Dick has 80 bits of data. What the hell's he gonna do with it? 	1) Trot around to the telco and say 'we'd like an unauthorised decrypting tap'. Uh huh. 	2) Break in to watergate and install his own tap (so his people still do have to break in, neat, huh?) record some noise, then get the Executive Branch Phone Decryption Box (huh? they've got one? Goodness, wait 'til the washington post gets hold of this) and decrypt the noise. 	3) More likely, stare at the key, and say 'Oh, hell it's not worth all this bloody hassle' 	Truth is, even granted *lots* of covert power on the part of the Executive Branch, this system is *more* difficult to tap with than POTS gear. The fact that it is easier to tap than some hypothetical system neither you nor I am going to place on our phones is neither here nor there. 	The only rational concerns I am seeing raised are: 	a) is the key really just chopped in half, and not some XOR arrangement? That is, has some egregious technical error been built in to the plan? 	b) is this is the first step toward strict regulation of strong encryption? >But that's not really the issue.

Besides, who is this mysterious 'they' who's going to take away all our rights the instant we let our guard down? Congress? That gang of buffoons can't even balance their checkbooks. The FBI?

There was an interesting column on the editorial page of the Dallas Morning News on Saturday by Walter Williams, who I believe is a professor at Georgetown (I wonder if he knows of Dorothy ""you're not in Kansas anymore"" Denning).  The article was titled ""Government slowly eroding our liberties"", and in it he tells a story attributed to the late Leonard Read who         explained that if you wanted to take liberty away from         Americans, you had to know how to cook a frog.  Mr. Read         said you can't cook a frog by boiling a pot of water and         then throwing the frog in.  His reflexes are so quick that         as soon as his feet touch the water, he will leap away.         You must put the frog in a pot of cold water and heat it         up bit by bit.  By the time the frog realizes he's being         cooked, it is too late.  It is the same with Americans.         If anyone tried to take our freedoms all at once, we         would naturally rebel and suppress the tyrant.  But as         with successful frog cooking, our liberties can be taken         a little bit at a time. The last line of the article says, ""It's not too late for us, but the water is getting pretty warm.""  I'd have toagree that it's warm and the Clipper is keeping the temperature on an upward course.

Here is some information ""from the horse's mouth"". (Regarding the sufficient overwriting of media (""clearing"") meant to be *retained* within the controlled environment, or declassifying the material to be reused *outside* the controlled environment,) From National Telecommunications and Information Systems Security (NTISS) ""Advisory Memorandum on Office Automation Security Guidelines""  (NTISSAM COMPUSEC/1/87): ------ ""7.6.2.1 Clearing of Magnetic Media Certain types of removable media (e.g., magnetic tape, floppy disk, cassettes, and magnetic cards) may be cleared by overwriting the entire media one time with any one character.  Floppy disks may be cleared by applying a vendor's formatting program that overwrites each location with a given character. Fixed media (e.g., Winchester disks) should be cleared by overwriting at least one time with any one character.  One way to do this is by applying a vendor-supplied formatting program that overwrites each location on the disk with a given character, if it can be shown that this program actually works as advertised.  The user should beware: some programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not actually do this. Cleared media may be resides within the controlled facility or released for destruction; however, they should be marked and controlled at the level of the most restrictive sensitivity of information ever recorded. 7.6.2.2 Declassification of Magnetic Media Certain types of removable media can be declassified using a degaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media of that type.  (A list of approved devices is maintained by the NSA.) If a fixed medium (for example, a hard, or Winchester, disk) is operative, an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to employ an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all addressable locations at least three times by writing any character, then its complement (e.g., binary ones and binary zeros) alternatively. When fixed  media become inoperative, it is impossible to declassify the media by the overwrite method.  In this case, there are two alternate procedures that may be used: (1) disassemble the disk pack, and degauss each platter with the appropriate approved degaussing equipment; and (2) courier the inoperative media to the vendor's facility, have the magnetic media (e.g., disk platter) removed in sight of the courier and returned to the courier for destruction at the secure site.  The vendor can then install new platters and repair any other problems with the disk unit. 7.6.3 Destruction of Magnetic Media"" [see DoD Computer Security Center, ""Department of Defense Magnetic Remanence Security Guideline"", CSC-STD-003-85  FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY] ------ This and many other interesting documents (many that are more informative than probably intended) on computer security procedures can be obtained (free) from: Executive Secretary National Telecommunications and Informations   Systems Security Committee National Security Agency Fort George G.

Being a PhD-student at David Chaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research in the field of privacy-protecting cash systems. The report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z, contains 77 pages, and can be retrieved from ftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180) from the directory pub/CWIreports/AA. The postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters. ==================================================================== ABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cash system based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which little use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the first to be based entirely on discrete logarithms.  Using the representation problem as a basic concept, some techniques are introduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier systems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in both computation and communication complexity than any such system proposed previously. Another important aspect of our system concerns its provability. Contrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be mathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if we make one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the ability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the Diffie-Hellman problem. Our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in previously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of these is that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be incorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has the important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the first place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender after the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under the most stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user, which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems. Another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have negligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by a simple mechanism from within the system, which is something that previous solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash system can be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, while retaining its computational efficiency. ==================================================================== Cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system! I made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as possible.  Nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail to me and I will try to reply as good as I can.

Her support of the clipper -- no matter how unpopular that position may be -- serves far more to enhance the clipper's respectability than to diminish her own.                            :: Jeff Makey Department of Tautological Pleonasms and Superfluous Redundancies Department     Disclaimer: All opinions are strictly those of the author.

I have thousands and thousands of other comics, so please let me know what you've been looking for, and maybe I can help.  Some titles I have posted here don't list every issue I have of that title, I tried to save space. I am willing to trade for other comics, computer equipment, video equipment, audio equipment, etc...  Let me know what you want to trade! -- Geoffrey R.

This is for the most part      a solid, restorable automobile.      Interior Condition:      Missing original steering wheel, has one of the smaller aftermarket      wheels, seats need reupholstered, general fair condition.      Mechanical Condition:      Had been running, but now does not want to start...needs new rings (which      I have) also have extra parts such as complete long block, extra steering      shaft, etc. For a car that has not been touched since 1958, it is in solid shape.  It will obviously need some work, but will make a good project. PRICE:  Well, this is a tough one, I would like to get around 800.00, but will consider any serious offers by individuals willing to come and get it.

Or be a Buddhist? The Buddha's commandments are 500 yrs older than Christ's and in my opinion tougher to follow. Moreover the Buddha says that we are intrinsically good (as against Christ's ""we are all sinners"").  Only we allow ourselves to be distracted. By meditating we can awaken ourselves (etc etc). Also there is no concept of God in Buddhism. (In my opinion you can be an Atheist and a Buddhist). But to ""awaken"" yourself is no easy task. Can you stay away from eating meat? Can you sit still and think of nothing (meditate) for sometime everyday? Buddhists do (or are supposed to). Can you pray five times a day? Can you fast for a month every year (Ramzan). Are you willing to give 1/6 th of your income as tithe? Muslims do. In fact I think Jesus was an ordinary man (just as Buddha and Mohamed) probably with a philosopy ahead of the times (where he lived). Considering the fact that Christianity is a young religion (compared to Hindiusm, Judaism, Zorasterism, Buddihsm) it is also very probable that the Bible is merely a collection of borrowed ideas. (There was a good deal of trade between the eastern lands and the middle east at the time of Christ). And perhaps some more.

I guess I would react rather strongly to this line of thinking carried out!  When you think ""your army"" is stronger than ""mine"", you would ""righteously"" take my children and baptize them, doing what you know is really ""best"" for them.    You cannot possibly put this kind of action, nor the crusades into the context of the teachings of Jesus/God.

Though I don't >mean to imply that all atheists are angry or hostile, >it does seem to be one motivation for giving up >faith.  Thus, some atheism might result from >broken-ness. I'd like to field this one, if I may.  Although I am a believer in and follower of Christ, my experiences with religion haven't been all that positive.  In fact, there was one point in my life when, for about three days, I simply _couldn't_ believe in the existence of God.  Anyway, when I look back upon the troubles I've had, they seem to fall into two categories -- impulses to unbelief that resulted from logical contradictions, and impulses to unbelief that resulted from frustration with God. The first category doesn't occur to me much anymore, as I have worked through most of the arguments for the non-existence of God.  But way back when, these would cause me some problems, and I would have to struggle with my faith to continue to believe.  I can see where others less stubborn than I (and I do mean stubborn.  Stubborness has often been the only thing standing between me an atheism from time to time) would fail. The second category arises out of some long-term personal difficulties and the struggle to live my life as God would have me live it WITHOUT living my life as others would tell me how God would have me live it.  A good example of this is my struggle with the more radical Christians I meet.  I am not, nor have I ever been, ""on fire for Chirst,"" and I don't think I ever want to be. Nevertheless, I am not ""lukewarm"" about my faith, so I don't really fit in with the mainstream either.  Quite naturally, I feel a lot of anxiety about my dislocation within Christian society, and it can lead to a lot of internal tension, when I want to do what I _know_ is right, but when another part of me believes that what I want to do is wrong because all the other Christians think so to.  Quite naturally, this tension has a destructive effect on my relationship with God, and during all of this internal strife, there's atheism sitting there like the promised land -- no rules, no responsibilities, no need to live up to anyone's expectations but my own. Complete freedom.  Of course, it's all an illusion, but nevertheless, it's a very appealing illusion, especially when the so-called ""people of God"" are behaving like total twits.  I can easily understand why someone would go that route, and would be hostile to ever coming back. IMHO, many of the former-Christians-turned-atheists-who-are-now-actively- hostile-to-Christianity are so because their experience with Christ and God wasn't a very peaceful one, but one of mind-control and ""shut-up-and-do-what- you're-told-because-we-know-what's-best-for-you-because-it's-God's-will-and- you're-to-young-to-know-what-God's-will-is-yet"" courtesy of some of Christ's more overzealous followers. A final reason why people become atheists is because Christians do not have a very good reputation right now.  One of the things that attracted people to Christianity in the ancient days was the love that Christians obviously had for one another and the world around them.  Unlike the rest of the world, Christian communities actively cared for their poor, and the Christian rich did not trod on the backs of their poorer brothers, but bent down to help them.  Christians were known for living exemplary lives, even if they were thought to be traitors to the state because they wouldn't sacrifice to the emporer.  Nowadays, courtesy of the media and some Christian leaders who lost Christ on their way to power, people see Christians as sexually-repressed hippocritical busibodies who want to remake society into a facist version of their own moral view. There are a lot more reasons why people become atheists, but I don't have time to go into them right now. Tom Ault"	other

A very specific, somewhat miraculous example of the truth of God working to help His followers is soemthing that happened to me. For nearly 4 years after an accident I had severe complications from a triple fracture in my left leg and surgery--pins put in, then removed. The bone itself was perfectly healed. No infectoin that could be detected. Yet I was in constant pain and it my ankle and foot were always swollen and bluish. More complicatios developed in my other leg, none of which could be explained by the best specialists and most sophisticated tests in te northern Illinois region. We went everywhere--no one could explain it. Durin gthat summer (June 19, 1991 to be exact) I gave my life and heart to Christ and vowed to relinquish control over my life (which i never really had anyway) because of what he did for me on the cross and the fact that my whole life was screwed up by me trying to fix it. I was facing the possibility of a lifetime in a wheelchair (I was confined to one in order to save my legs from any further damage since the cause of my problems were unknown, had been in it for about 2 1/2 months before that day). 	I found it ore than coincidental that less than 2 weeks after I put my faith where my mouth was, one more in the long line of doctors and not even an orthopeodic specialist, diagnosed my problems with no difficulty, set me on the path to an effective cure, and I was walking and running again without the pain that had stopped me from that for 4 years. The diagnosis was something he felt the other doctors must have ""overlooked"" because it was perfectly obvious from my test results. 	Maybe this doesn't hit you as miraculous. But to me it really is. Imagine an active 17 year old being told she may not be able to walk mcuh longer...and is now a happy 18 year old who can dance and run knowing that the problem was there all along and was ""revealed"" just after she did what she knew was right. As the song says... 	""Our God is an awesome God...."""	other

I don't claim to be an expert on the branch Davidians, but I might know more than most. The Branch Davidian group (led by Koresh) is actually one of two off-shoots of a group known as the Shephard's Rod.  The Shephard's Rod (now defunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's. The Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the SDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they were the remnant spoken about in Revelation. About the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once in control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as Christ. Koresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over the youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians. They were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of weapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US government or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were putting themselves in a self defense position. In my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn' t have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco. If you want to know about The Shephard's Rod, you might want to visit the local SDA church and talk to some of the older people.  They could give you some insight into where Koresh got his theology.

I'm not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame (thanx in advance) I want to know why there are so many different versions of the bible? There is this version of the bible I have read about and on the front page it says: ""....contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies."" 					Thanx in advance... Shaz.... [I'm not sure quite what you mean by many different versions. The primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style of the translation.  It's pretty unusual to see significant differences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying text.  That's because before printing, manuscripts were copied by hand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts around that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the original, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are generally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are something like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved, but with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I don't think there's much uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians believe that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of translating is free of error.  But I also don't think there's enough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that it has much practical effect. Whether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot topic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it (though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details that don't affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there being multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in all the versions.  I'm surprised to find a reference to this on the title page though.  What version are you talking about?  I've been referring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get referenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been editions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes everything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into single narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor objects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible has long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making editions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editions that are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from a variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagine one of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all inaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, it's not any edition that's widely used.  The widely used ones leave the text as is. (Weeeeelllllll, almost as is.  It's been alleged that a few translations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize inconsistencies.  Because translation is not an exact science, there are always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best, I'm afraid.) --clh]"	other

Why isn't it a specific feature of homosexuality?  Paul describes ""men with men working that which is unseemly"" to describe the acts. Sure, there spirtual nature was depraved also, and like the other sins, the idolatry, the other sexual immoraity, and the other sins sprang from their depraved spiritual state which was a result of man's not glorifying God as God and being thankful.  Still, their acts were shameless. >homosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases.  On the >other hand, none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the >subject.  Rom 1 is really about idolatry.  It refers to homosexuality >in passing. Is everything sinful specifically elaborated on in the New Testament? Scripture does not condemn being a drug dealer.  Being ruled by the Spirit rather than the letter not only frees from legalism, it also protects us from sins that are against the Spirit.  The word is a two edged sword that cuts both ways. I think we must be careful before we totally throw out Leviticus. If the Law is reflection of God's character and true holy nature, then those who say that God endorses homosexuality run into a problem. If homosexuality were ""natural"" (whatever that means) wholesome, endorsed by God, and those who oppose sexual behavior are narrow-minded biggots, as some would have us believe, why is there a condemnation of it in Leviticus.  This condemnation is in the midst of all the other sex sin condemnations, and there is nothing in the text to say that this law was limited to temple prostitution, and no good reason to believe that this was the case.  Furthermore, male homosexual sex was a death-penalty crime! Is every sin elaborated on in the New Testament?  Take a look at I Corinthians 5.  Paul said that one of the Corinthians had broken a law not even heard of among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.  There is a prohibition against having your father's wife in Leviticus.  No other new Testament verse clearly condemns it (besides this one.)  Notice that Paul did not say that the sin was in commiting adultery, etc.- he spoke against having one's father's wife. Notice also that this sexual condemnation in Leviticus is not mentioned in the specific context of paganism either.  And there was no pagan coustom mentioned in I corinthians either.  As a matter of fact taking one's father's wife wasn't even done among the Gentiles.  It was just a plain blantant sin, whether worshipping idols was involved or not. >One commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds >of questions we are trying to deal with.  He encountered homosexuality >only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was >wrong.  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act >""straight"" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying >to define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian >ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the >relationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Paul's >judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make >judgements on these questions. One of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument is because Paul probably did face this and other problems.  Sin can be tough to over come, especially without supernatural power.  Is homosexual sin any more difficult to overcome that heterosexual sin, like lusting after a married woman, or sleeping around with people of the opposite sex?  I doubt it, and even if it is, that is no excuse. God is greater than all of it. Another reason we reject it is because it ignores the supernatural power of God to intervene in this kind of situation.  How many people have been set free from sin by the power of God?  Sure there may be any groups that have tried to change homosexuals and failed. That is a reflection on the people involved in the program, and not God's willingness and ability to change a sinner.  Any program that uses formulas may fail.  What people need is the power of God to change them, whether they are involved in homosexual sin, or any other sin. >I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is >not entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.  Paul's >tendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating >holidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues >to look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and to >avoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging. >For example, while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat >meat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about >which they had personal qualms. I don't see how you come to that conclusion.  Paul's dealings with pastorial issues encouraged people to give up their liberties in order to spare others- not to allow people to continue in sin because it was just too difficult.  Take the example of eating meat offered to idols. Paul felt that there was nothing wrong, in an abstract sense, with eating the meat.  Yet he advised believers to sacrifice their liberty to eat meat in order to spare others. But Paul never allowed people to sin because living holy was just to tough.  Paul wrote to ""make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof.""  (Romans 13:14)  Then he goes in to a discourse on how we should sacrifice our own liberty in order to spare the consciences of others. Suppose it were not a sin for people to practice homosexual acts. Since others consider it to be a sin, then using Paul's approach on pastorial issues, those who would otherwise be homosexuals should sacrifice their liberty and be celbate or monogamously married to a member of the opposite sex.  Paul never offers a lesser sin (homosexual ""marriage"") to prevent people from engaging in what may be considered a more damaging sin. >For another example, Paul obviously >would have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances) >remain unmarried.  Yet if they were unable to do so, he certainly >would rather see them married than in a state where they might be >tempted to fornication. Yet marriage itself is not a sin.  marriage is holy in all- and something that God ordains, and Paul recognizes this. > Note that in the >creation story work enters human life as a result of sin.  This >doesn't mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved. Actually, Adam was put in the garden to tend to it before he fell. After he fell he would have to toil over the ground. >The dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often >fails, and when it does, you end up with damage ranging from >psychological damage to suicide, as well as broken marriages when >attempts at living as a heterosexual fail. That is why we are dependent totally on God- what a vunerable and glorious position to be it.  We all must be transformed by the renewing of our minds- and that is the only way homosexuals can walk in freedom, just like anyone else. >but I can well imagine Paul >preferring to see people in long-term, committed Christian >relationships than promiscuity.  As with work -- which Genesis >suggests wasn't part of God's original ideal either -- I think such >relationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God's love >with each other. I'm sure you can see how people with the opposing view see this conclusion.  It's like saying, ""How should I kill myself, with gun or aresenic?  What about the person who just is overcome with a desire to sleep with goats?  Would it be better for him to sleep with one goat, or all of them?  What about the person who wants to sleep with his aunts? Would it be better for him to sleep with one aunt or all of them? In all these cases, the more people or animals one sleeps with, the higher the chance that they will get a disease.  But this only deals with physical aspects of the question.  Whichever sin is commited, it all leads to spiritual death. >Cent. actions are the same.  When Christian homosexuals say that their >relationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul >would have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind of >argument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors. The issue that is most often addressed in Scripture seems to be the actual act.  Second, isn't it historical snobbery to say that only homosexuals of this century are capable of having ""loving relationships?""  There are ancient writings glorifying homosexual ""love."" (btw, I am one who believes in refraining from making oathes.  Also, where do you get that tax collectors are sinners.  That's certainly not explicit.  Jesus didn't tell Zachias to quit his job.) Link Hudson. [I'm reluctant to comment in this in detail.  Our basic concepts of the intention of Jesus and Paul are greatly different.  As I indicated in the article, whatever the ambiguities of various words (and I still think they are significant), it does seem clear that Paul considered the homosexuality he saw around him wrong.  What you do with this fact depends upon your basic approach to the Bible.  I'm afraid that communication between legalist and anti-legalist Christians is even harder than between Protestants and Catholics in the 16th Cent.  Since you disagree with my starting point, obviously you're going to disagree with all of the intermediate discussion and conclusions. Sometimes discussion is still useful.  I've seen some very interesting work on Paul done by Jews.  Obviously they don't agree with him, but they sometimes have helpful insight into what he meant.  But I don't see much sign for hope here.  In talk.religion.misc there's an axiom that by the time Hitler's name is invoked, all hope for sensible discussion is gone.  On this subject, when sleeping with goats is invoked, I don't think there's enough basis for understanding to be worth pursuing.  --clh]"	other

I was unable to put it down the first time I read it, but others have found it dry.  It has numberable references and illustrations.  If you are interested in purchasing your own copy, you can call Moody Book Store @ (312)329-4352 and order it for $16.99 and they will ship it to you.   It is a good book just to get the reference titles for your own digs into the mystery religions.  I have found it invaluable for that purpose alone.  But for those who only want to skim the subject, it comes highly recommended.   Just a note to my RC brothers and sisters.  You may find this to be a diatribe or you may find it to be a test to the origin and true nature of the origin of RCism.  If you are offended by anything that asks hard questions about your denomination (as to whether or not it is ""Christian"") then perhaps you should just passover this offer.  To those who are a little more adventurous, go for it and later, please contact me with you reasons pro or con on the scholorship of this book.

I have used Glockenspeil commonview under Motif and OS2.  I wrote a resource converter from OS2 to Motif, but it really wasn't too easy, especially the naming scheme. In Motif you cannot rename controls/widgets. With windows you can call the OK button ID_OK in every instance, this doesn't work for Motif, you'd have to call it Dialog1_OK, and Motif expects a text string rather than a number.  So your constructor should know how to convert a #define into the proper resource identifier. I'd check on how the toolkit expects names, and that if it does use resources, that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to port to. ( By the way, I would never use CommonView or Glockenspiel for anything ) Alex. -- __  __|       \      __|       Alex Colburn    |       /   \    |          Image Analysis Facility    |      _____ \   __|	       University of Iowa ______| _/      _\ _|          colburn@tessa.iaf.uiowa.edu"	other

If you are planning on using this on a regular basis, conncting the printer to file can become bothersome because Windows then asks you for the filename that you want to create. I've found that putting a line in system.ini in the ports section with just a path and filename works. The only problem is that if you send more than one job, the second one deletes the first.

I found 3 shareware Workspace Managers, from Australia's MS-WINDOWS archive (monu6.cc.monash.edu.au), which mirrors some sites in the U.S.  The three I found were: 1. WORKSPACES 1.10 (wspace.zip)                                 This was the smallest and simplest    of the workspace managers that I found.  It is very easy to use.    It displays a small window, containing 6 buttons, plus an extra    button for configuration purposes.  One annoying feature was the    title window that is first presented when it is run - you must press    a key (not a mouse button!) for the thing to go away.  Also, it would    have been nice if there was an ""ALWAYS ON TOP"" setting for the little    window containing the workspace buttons.  Maybe some user-specified    strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be    a nice feature.  The simplicity and ease of use of this workspace    manager makes it an attractive package. 2. WORKSHIFT 1.6 (wrksft16.zip)                                While this workspace manager offered a    few features that WORKSPACES 1.10 lacked, it was quite time consuming    to set things up.  With WORKSPACES 1.10, all but the first workspace    is initially empty.  With WORKSHIFT 1.6, you need to take ""snapshots""    of how you want each of your workspaces to look like - i.e. what    applications they contain.  Also, the main window is quite large,    but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace.    With WORKSPACES 1.10, there was no facility for viewing what was in    a workspace without switching to it.  WORKSHIFT 1.6 provides this    viewing functionality which is quite useful. 3. BIGDESK 2.30 and BACKMENU (backdesk.zip)                             This is an interesting package, which contains    a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager.  Other goodies    include ""Backmenu"", which provides a pop-up root menu when you    press a certain mouse button - just like in X-Windows.  The menu    is totally configurable, offering unlimited depth of cascading menus,    which is provides quite handy access to applications.  You could    say it is a menu-based alternative to the program manager.  Also    bundled in ""backdesk.zip"" is a program called ""WRUN"", which allows    you to run windows applications from a DOS shell under WINDOWS    instead of using the File Manager to run applications.    The actual workspace manager is called BIGDESK 2.30.  BIGDESK works quite    differently to the other two workspace managers in that it    doesn't provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces.    In fact, it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount,    and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to    focus in on.  This means you can have windows overlapping between different    viewing regions, unlike the first two workspace managers in which    each workspace was isolated from the other one.  The BIGDESK control window    allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop.  Basically    the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area    while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow-up    of a particular section. Try each of them out for yourself.  I was impressed with all of them, so find out which one suits your needs the best."	other

Here's my question: CONTEXT: I use a package called SLIP on my home computer to connect to the          university mainframe (an IBM 3090 running VMS/MVS), and log on to my          account. When I installed SLIP on my computer, I had to configure it          for my modem (14.4 kbs Etronics internal) and had to supply the phone          number to dial to reach the mainframe. The way it works now is that          I type ""telnet uicvm"" or ""tn3270 uicvm"" (either will work) at the DOS          prompt. UICVM is the node name of the mainframe. The program then          dials the mainframe, establishes a protocol, and gives me the logon          screen. ""TELNET"" and ""TN3270"" are the names of batch files in my SLIP          directory. I have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the          session. PROBLEM: I would like to be able to do all this under Windows 3.1 because I          hardly ever use DOS directly. SLIP will not run under Windows. I          talked to the people at our computer center, and they suggested that          I use a packet driver called WINPKT.COM with SLIP. They gave me          instructions on how to load it before I start Windows, and how to          modify the TCPSTART and TCPSTOP batch files (in the SLIP directory)          to ensure that it would work. I did all that and I could run SLIP          from Windows, but there were other problems. For one thing, SLIP          would not hang up the phone when I exited. I had to run my communi-          cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when          that didn't work. For another, there were too many errors. It often          took me 3-4 tries to connect to the mainframe. Our computer center          does not support SLIP under Windows, so I can't keep going back to          them with more questions. QUESTION: Is there some other SHAREWARE package that will run under Windows          and do what SLIP is supposed to do? I need a package that is not too          expensive, which is why I am looking for shareware. I have heard that          there are regular commercial packages that do all this, but they cost          hundreds of dollars. These are the main requirements:          1. Must be able to run under Windows 3.1          2. Must allow VT100 and IBM TN3270 terminal emulation          3. Must allow ftp file transfers, since that's the only kind the             mainframe allows. No Y-modem or Z-modem etc. I believe the ftp             transfers are made through a kermit protocol, but I'm hazy about             that.          A subsidiary feature (that would be nice to have) if it's a true          Windows program (rather than a DOS program modified to run under          Windows) is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently          with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet          session and other applications. Any information received is appreciated. Pankaj Saxena u09416@uicvm.uic.edu"	other

Don't know on the last one. And why they are considering using WinBench as a test, they may want to read everything Steve Gibson has said on the subject in his InfoWorld column the past couple of month.  In short, virtually every board manufacturer cheats on the test by writing things in the driver that is there only to make the board appear faster on the WinBench suite.  So the WinBench score has no bearing in reality to how cards stack up on real world tasks. In the last PC-Magazine they benchmarked some of the new accelerators, and admitted that many of them 'cheated' on WinBench.  Interestingly, they 'allowed' one type of cheating behaviour (caching for bitblt operations, no matter how unreal), yet did not allow a couple of other types of cheating behaviour that some of the cards used.  At least one card was eliminated from the ""Editor's Choice"" because of cheating on the benchmark. >Al DeVilbiss >al@col.hp.com"	other

Yet, Write does >display the font correctly on the screen. This is a common problem with highly complex TrueType fonts.  Microsoft admits to a problem with older versions of the PostScript printer driver, but I've found it to be pretty generic. You can get around the problem by adjusting the parameter OutlineThreshold in the [TrueType] section of WIN.INI.  This entry specifies the number of pels-per-em at which Windows will render TrueType fonts as outline fonts instead of as bitmap fonts.  The default is 256.  I've generally been able to get fonts to work by setting OutlineThreshold=160.  Depending on your printer resolution and the point size you are using, you may need a different value. The Windows Resource Kit warns against going above 300.  Presumably, that might cause fonts to print as square boxes or something.  :-|  (I'm not smiling.) -- Bob Nichols AT&T Bell Laboratories rnichols@ihlpm.ih.att.com	other

I have a 286 with a GVGA-16 video board.  I've been using the standard Windows VGA driver with other similarly configured computers. I am thinking that my problem is with the way Windows refreshes it's screen. The problem is that once Windows has been envoked, the colors start changing themselves.  At first I thought it was hardware, but if you open a full screen DOS program from within the Windows session, you don't have any problems until you get back to Windows - however, when you initially return to Windows, the original colors get refreshed properly. Also, it is not a uniform color change - so if you are in solitaire, the design on the back of the card maintains it's original color scheme, but the white fronts of the cards will turn grey, then blue, etc. The color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark purple-ish black.  If you pop out to DOS and exit back to Windows - the screen gets refreshed again. If I don't log into Windows and just do DOS things from the Novell network, everything is fine. I originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the other machine I had just finished configuring, then from the net to this machine.  When I ran into problems, I deleted everything on this machine and the net, and tried bouncing it again.  When that didn't work, I tried reloading Windows to no avail. Any thoughts on things to check out?  I am totally baffled! Thanks in advance for any assistance and instruction! Linda Cornell lcornell@u.washington.edu UW Office of Research	other

There are some things you might be interested to know about today's RISC processors.  It is true that there are fewer instructions, but what is not commonly known is that this causes the size of your executables to swell, so that in some cases performance is similar for larger applications. As a compromise, many RISC processors today are actually a cross between a Reduced Instructions Set, and a Complex one.

The argument was 1) Defense, or runs allowed, is 50% of the game. 2) Unearned runs amount to 12% of the runs allowed; earned runs, 88%. 3) Since unearned runs are the result of fielding, not pitching, and earned runs are the product of pitching, not fielding, fielding is 12% of defense and pitching is 88% of defense. 4) Caombining with #1, pitching is 44% of the game, fielding 6%. Pete is usually sharper than that. My own feel is that fielding is in the 25-33% of defense range; call it 30-70 between fielding and pitching. >One also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning, with the >split probably somewhere around 49.5% and 0.5%. I'd give baserunning a little more credit than that, maybe 45-5, or even 40-10. Give a team of Roberto Alomar and a team of John Oleruds identical batting stats (which wouldn't be that unreasonable), and even if you don't let Roberto steal a single base, they'll score a lot more than the Oleruds by going first-to-third more often.

Sorry this is after Opening Day.  I certify that these were completed before the first pitch. :-) AL East 1.  New York Yankees - the most (only?) improved team in this division 2.  Toronto Blue Jays - Stewart and Morris?  No way. 3.  Milwaukee Brewers - they always seem to do better than I expect 4.  Baltimore Orioles - Pitching, but Devareaux, Anderson, and Hoiles will drop 5.  Cleveland Indians - Still don't seem to know what they are doing 6.  Detroit Tigers - All key players but Fryman are another year past peak 7.  Boston Red Sox - Any team with Clemens and Viola might be beter than 7th Al West - this division was the toughest for me to pick.  Whoever of the top           4 gets pitching should win it. 1.  Minnesota Twins - young pitchers seem to have best chance for success 2.  Texas Rangers - I don't know why I have them here.  Jose Canseco? 3.  Chicago White Sox - Frank Thomas but no pitching. 4.  Oakland A's - LaRussa is the best manager and would keep any team close 5.  Seattle Mariners - I like Pinella, but don't see much here 6.  Kansas City Royals - will score no runs 7.  California Angels - will win no games NL East 1.  Montreal Expos - good all around, plus no Wallach! 2.  St. Louis Cardinals - (Jeffries + Whiten) >> (Jose + Clark), no Galarraga 3.  Pittsburgh Pirates - youngsters will take up more slack than expected 4.  New York Mets - some good players, still not a ""team"" 5.  Philadelphia Phillies - they don't impress me 6.  Florida Marlins - they know what they're doing 7.  Chicago Cubs - they don't know what they're doing NL West - The 2 best teams in baseball are in this division. 1.  Atlanta Braves - Awesome starters, but offense could be a concern 2.  Cincinnati Reds - Would not surprise me if they won it all 3.  Houston Astros - Any team that signs Uribe won't contend. Closer to 4 than 2 4.  San Diego Padres - Plantier could be the Sheffield of 1993 5.  Los Angeles Dodgers - better pitching than the Giants 6.  San Francisco Giants - because the Rockies just stink 7.  Colorado Rockies - will become the Seattle Mariners of the NL. NLCS  Montreal d. Atlanta  (Braves fans, yes I'm probably contradicting                             what I said in my NL West comment.) ALCS  New York d. Minnesota World Series  New York d.

Sabo		1539	452	.294		259	59	.228 Samuel		1564	383	.245		278	83	.299 > >Sabo is clearly a better hitter than Samuel.  Yet you would pinch-hit >Samuel because you predict that Samuel will be a clutch hitter and >Sabo will be a choke hitter.  Right?  I'd call that ""predicting the >future"". That is *your* opinion that Sabo is ""clearly a better hitter"" than Samuel.  The above data is for a 4-year period ending last season. Last season Samuel batted .272 while Sabo hit .244 (not park adjusted). This season they are both hitting below .200, albeit Sabo with more at bats.  I will agree that over his career Sabo has been a better hitter than Samuel, but I will also remind you that Samuel has been a better hitter in certain situations than Sabo. I did not predict that Sabo would choke, nor that Samuel would get a hit.  I expressed my opinion that had I been the Reds manager (or even a Reds fan) that I would prefer to have Samuel hit in that situation than Sabo. >>If you were to have been the Reds manager at that time, I assume you >>would have had some basis for letting Sabo hit rather than pinch- >>hitting Samuel.

That is, I haven't yet found someone who hit significantly below his overall batting average in clutch situations for the years 1989 - 91, and then reversed that relationship in 1992. >Gambler's fallacy.

I've seen a detailed study of >why I *shouldn't* expect it to correlate. Nope.  Sorry.  But if you were interested in a reason why I expect Chris Sabo's ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one year to the next, I think I could.  If you were interested in a reason why I expect Joe Carter's ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one year to the next, I think I could.  But you're not interested in that, because you think that those conclusions could only be valid if they could be extrapolated over the entire baseball population.  And they can't be. >The ""stupid"" was in reference to a statement which *was* stupid.  (And >I don't see how you can deny it.)  As for ""total idiot""?  Yes.  If you >prove yourself unwilling to even *consider* evidence that might >suggest that you are wrong, I would say the term fits nicely. The problem here is that I *do* believe you.  I accept your work. I believe that trying to predict future clutch performance based on prior clutch history is meaningless.  No better than a coin toss. I actually *do* accept your work. As it happens, I also have an *opinion* that in certain situations, for certain players, a history of superior or inferior ability to hit in the clutch might suggest a reason what such history could be valid in projecting future player performance.  For that player. And Chris Sabo is one such player. >So tell me?  Does the term fit?  Or do you have an open mind? Well, since I defer to your statistical wisdom, I think I must have an open mind.

This certainly isn't irrelevant, and iif you replace Morris with replacement level quality the Blue Jays might not win. Re leadership, I don't see it.  If the leadership effect is there for a starting pitcher, you would expect to see its primary effect on the pitching staff.  You would expect to see the rest of the staff improve. Instead, the rest of the staff declined. You can make a reasonable argument for Winfield providing leadership; the offense picked up considerably from its effectiveness the previous year.

Actually, I think the large-scale sample size is part of the problem. It seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball in regard to BA vs. Clutch BA deviation we would get some kind of bell curve.  (The X-axis being the +/- deviation in clutch hitting vs. non-clutch;  the Y-axis being the number of players.)  Certainly there would be *some* players on the extreme ends of the bell.  My *supposition* is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently (year after year) at one end of the bell or the other, then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusions about *those* players (as opposed to all baseball players).   As a counterexample to >what you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987: > >               Non-Clutch                      Clutch >               AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA > >Maldonado      1060    260     .245            254     78      .307 >Lemon          1643    457     .278            256     57      .223 > >If you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those ""clutch"" >situations, you'd bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye.  Well, in >1988, Maldonado hit .267 in ""non-clutch"" and .190 in ""clutch"", while Lemon >hit .254 in ""non-clutch"" and .313 in ""clutch"".  Before you accuse me of >completely cooking the data, You won't hear those kind of accusations from me.  It is interesting that you selected Maldonado, because he is someone whom I have also looked at.  He has been a very inconsistent hitter (in terms of BA), hitting in 1989 - 92  .217, .273, .250, .272    Admittedly, he has been traded between leagues as well as clubs.  His clutch hitting record is equally inconsistent.  So, for my purposes in 1993 I would not draw any conclusions about his ability to hit in the clutch based on his prior performance.  I don't know how I would have felt in 1988, but you may indeed be right. When I looked at Sabo I found a more consistent record of hitting, and a more consistent pattern of his clutch hitting being proportionately below his non-clutch BA.  Ditto for Joe Carter. This probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having with others on this topic.  Must any conclusion based on statistical history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before it has any validity?  Is it impossible (or irrational) to apply statistical analysis to selected components of the data base? >BTW, correlating players' _overall_ batting average from '84-'87 with >'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at >something better than the 99.9% confidence level.

I'm sure some of that basis would have utilized >prior performance.  You just wouldn't have used this particular >aspect of prior performance.  Is this not correct? Right.  I would have used aspects of prior performance which have been shown to be consistent in the past.  Overall performance, L/R splits, even matching hitting/pitching styles.  All of these will give me some advantage if used properly. EVEN IF ALL ELSE WERE EQUAL, there would be no advantage gained by looking at past clutch performance.  And in this case, everything else pointed to Sabo. >One more time.  I did *not* claim to be able to predict the future. >I said that I accept the above data as an indication that Samuel would >have had a better chance for success in that situation than Sabo. That comes down to the same thing.  When Perez left Sabo in, he was predicting the future, the next AB.  He was predicting that Sabo was more likely to get a hit than Samuel. By supporting the swap, you are predicting the opposite. >And I am not dismissing your work.

It has not proven to be an indicator of future performance under *any* circumstances.  At least none that we've been able to come up with.

We can then test this rule on past data to see if it worked for recent years.

New Method For Diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease Discovered at Huntington Medical Research Institutes: Results to Be Reported  To: National Desk, Health Writer  Contact: John Lockhart or Belinda Gerber, 310-444-7000, or           800-522-8877, for the Huntington Medical Research           Institutes.    LOS ANGELES, April 28  -- A new method for diagnosing and measuring chemical imbalances in the brain which lead to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias has been discovered by researchers at the Huntington Medical Research Institutes (HMRI) in Pasadena, Calif.  Results of their research will be reported in the May issue of the scientific journal, Radiology.    Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a research team led by Brian D. Ross, M.D., D. Phil., conducted a study on 21 elderly patients who were believed to be suffering from some form of dementia. The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with special software developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS.  Clinical Proton MRS is easily applied, giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses in less than 30 minutes.  An automated version of Clinical Proton MRS called Proton Brain Examination (PROBE) reduces the examination time yet further, providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10 minutes.  By comparison, the current ""standard of care"" in testing for Alzheimer's disease calls for lengthy memory function and neuropsychological tests, which can be very upsetting to the patient, are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy.    In addition to Alzheimer's disease, the new Clinical Proton MRS exam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias, including AIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease.    ""We've developed a simple test which can be administered quickly and relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fitted with either the MRS or PROBE software,"" said Dr. Ross, adding, ""this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer's earlier and intervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease causes further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain.""    Dr. Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in the brain known as inositols, and myo-inositol (MI) acted as a marker in the study.  In comparison to healthy patients, those diagnosed with Alzheimer's showed a 22 percent increase in MI, while their level of another chemical called N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was significantly lower, indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neurons believed to be associated with the progression of the disease.    Current drug therapy for Alzheimer's disease is widely considered to be inadequate.  This is attributable, Dr. Ross believes, to the theory that Alzheimer's is caused by an interruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to the nerve cells. This belief has been adhered to over the last 15 years, and consequently, most drugs to treat Alzheimer's were based on the changing receptors for acetylcholine.    ""Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate Alzheimer's from other dementias, to provide the patient and his or her family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment protocols for the treatment of this disease.  For this reason, we consider this test a major advancement in medicine,"" said Bruce Miller, M.D., a noted neurologist at Harbor-UCLA, MRS researcher and a co-author of the study.    Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex A. Moats, Ph.D., Truda Shonk, B.S., Thomas Ernst, Ph.D., and Suzanne Woolley, R.N.  The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately 1,200 General Electric MRI units currently in use in the United States, and will be configured for other manufacturers' MRI units soon.    For interviews with Dr. Ross, advance copies of the Radiology May issue, and other information, please contact John Lockhart or Belinda Gerber for HMRI at 310-444-7000 or 800-522-8877.    Q & A on Alzheimer's Disease:    What is Alzheimer's disease and how is it caused?    Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable degenerative disease of the brain first described in 1906 by the German neuropathologist Alois Alzheimer.  As the disease progresses, it leads to loss of memory and mental functioning, followed by changes in personality, loss of control of bodily functions, and, eventually, death.    How many people does it affect?    Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 4 million adults in the United States and is the fourth leading cause of death, taking approximately 100,000 lives each year.  While Alzheimer's debilitates its victims, it is equally devastating, both emotionally and financially, for patients' families.  AD is the most common cause of dementia in adults.  Symptoms worsen every year, and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset.    What are its signs and symptoms?    Although the cause of AD is not known, two risk factors have been identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition.  The risk of developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 50 yars old, but increases steeply in each successive decade of life to reach 30 percent by the age of 90.  In patients with familial AD, immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance of developing AD.  One of its first symptoms is severe ""forgetfulness"" caused by short-term memory loss.  Dr. Herman Weinreb of the School of Medicine at New York University says ""whether forgetfulness is a serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree"" and suggests the following criteria:    -- Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is       normal.    -- Forgetting the name of a loved one is serious.    -- Forgetting where you left your keys is normal.    -- Forgetting how to get home is serious.    Doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be evaluated in order to rule out Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.  -30- -- Canada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontario 416-629-7000/629-7044"	other

Dept. - New Mexico Tech Lines: 46 Nntp-Posting-Host: baltic 	For a very long time I've had a problem with feeling really awful when I try to get up in the morning.  My sleep latency at night is also pretty long,  ranging from 30 min to an hour.  I get about 7 hours of bedtime (maybe 6 of actual sleep) a night and more on the weekends.  I will spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if I can,  because I feel so tired when I wake up,  even more tired than I was when I went to bed,  which is usually too tired to work. 	Anyway,  I recently had a really bad flu,  so I called a friend to get me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant; but he got Vicks formula 44M which has everything but an expectorant.  So I used that anyway,  and the three nights I used it,  I fell asleep rapidly and felt that I got really good quality sleep -- that is,  I actually felt refreshed the next morning. 	So,  I am now trying to look into,  both in the literature and experimentally,  the use of antihistamines as sleep aids,  since I am presuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect.  The antihistamine in Vicks formula 44 is Chloriphenamine maleate,  so I bought some generic tablets of that,  and tried one last night and didn't notice any improvement.  I might try one with a little alcohol (about 1 beer) to see if it is a synergism effect.  Also,  library research seems to show that Benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongest sedative effect of what is availible OTC.  So I might also buy a generic form of that and try that;  the PDR seems to suggest that 50 mg is a good dosage level to try. 	For other medical information,  I have allergies but rarely have an allergic reaction living in New Mexico.  I also have chronically dry eyes,  which get horrible if I try to use most underarm deoderants.  I did guess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia,  so I made some changes in my diet consistent with that,  and it didn't help,  so I went back to a normal diet (Pretty diverse,  also taking vitamin supplements) 	Anyway,  I am looking for advice for the use of antihistamines as sleep aids,  and if there are any dangers of such use (Seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies by millions).  I don't want to try BZs,  because BZ addiction seems to be a serious threat,  and from what I hear,  BZ sleep quality is not good, whereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me.

(Although I've already tried >many of the non-pharmacological solutions) Well, I think you might want to visit a doctor who is familiar with sleep disturbances, because antihistamines only help induce sleep when they're used intermittently; they lose their sedative effect if they're used on a nightly basis.  Their anticholinergic effects (drying of secretions, relaxing effects on smooth muscle) can be problematic in some people, such as those with glaucoma or prostate enlargement. Antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or doxylamine (Unisom) are potent sedatives which are useful occasionally.  Chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton) is said to be less sedative, but 8mg seems to work well in some people.  Both chlorpheniramine and doxylamine have long half-lives compared to diphenhydramine, and so may produce a residual hangover or ""drugged"" feeling the next morning. -- Steve Dyer dyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer"	other

Med. Nutrition and I'm posting my answer here.  Only 22 medical schools in the U.S. teach courses on human nutrition.  We have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can do when candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical community. I think that the best example of where U.S. medicine is really missing the mark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is PMS.  So many women(and their husbands) suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that most physicians in the U.S. are not taught that PMS is primarily caused by diet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening.  Before shooting your flames, read the entire article and then decide if flaming is justified. From A Poster In Sci. Medi. Nutrition: > 	In a psychological anthropology course I am taking, we got > sidetracked onto a short conversation about PMS.  Some rumors shared > by several of the students included ideas that vitamin levels, sugar > intake, and caffeine intake might affect PMS symptoms. > 	Is there any data on this, or is it just so much hooey? > > Many thanks, > > Michael, I've wanted to reply to this post ever since I saw it but I got side-tracked with candida.  PMS is a lot like Candida blooms, most physicians don't recognize it as a specific ""disease"" entity.  Here is everything that you would ever want to know about PMS. Premenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups: 	PMT-A(Anxiety)		PMT-D(depression) 	anxiety			depression 	irritability		forgetfulness 	insomnia		confusion 	depression		lethargy 	PMT-C(Craving)		PMT-H(Hyperhydration) 	craving for sweets	weight gain 	increased appetite	breast congestion and tenderness 	sugar ingestion causes: abdominal bloating and tenderness 	 1. headache		edema of the face and extremities 	 2. palpitations 	 3. fatigue or fainting PMT-A is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low progesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women's cycle. PMT-C is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple carbohydrates.  During the luteal phase of a women's cycle, there is increased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose challenge.  The metabolic findings believed to be responsible for PMT-C are a low magnesium and a low prostaglandin E1.  This condition of hypoglycemia is not unique to PMS but there are a number of different causes of hypoglycemia, magnesium and PGE1 seem to be specific to PMS hypoglycemia. 	A. Am. J. Psychiatry 147(4):477-80(1990). Unrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar, magnesium supplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation(increased to 5-6% of the total calories) using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources of alpha linoleic acid. PMT-D is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase of a women's cycle.  Another cause of PMT-D has been found to be lead toxicity(in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase). ""Effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human endometrial cystol"" Fertil. Steril. 28:312-18(1972). PMT-H is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated serum aldosterone level.  Salt restriction, B6, magnesium and vitamin E for breast tenderness have all been effective in treating PMT-H This general discussion of the PMS syndromes came form: 	A. ""Management of the premenstrual tension sundromes: Rational for 	    a nutritional approach"". 1986, A Year in Nutritional Medicine. 	    J. Bland, Ed. Keats, Publishing, 1986. 	B. ""Nutritional factors in the etiology of premenstrual tension 	    syndromes"", J. Reprod. Med.28(7):446-64(1983). 	C. ""Premenstrual tension"", Prob. Obstet. Gynecol. 3(12):1-39(1980) Treatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can find a doctor who will treat you for PMS(just about as hard as finding one that will treat you for candida blooms).  While progesterone will work, supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better.  There really has been an awful lot of research done on PMS(much more than candida blooms).  Many of these studies have been what are called experimental controlled studies(the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to see done). Here are a few of these studies: 	CARBOHYDRATE: Experimental Controlled Study, ""Effect of a low-fat, 	high-carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy"" Lancet 	2:128-32(1988).  21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy 	of at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive 	specific training to reduce dietary fat to 15% of total calories 	and increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary 	advise with no training.  After 6 months, there was a significant 	reduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in 	the trained group as reported by self-reported symptoms as well as 	physical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling, 	tenderness and nodularity. 	VITAMIN A: Experimental Controlled Study, ""The use of Vitamin A in 	premenstrual tension"" Acta Obstet. Gynecol Scand. 39:586-92(1960). 	218 pts with severe recurring PMS received 200,000 to 300,000IU 	vitamin A daily or a placebo.  Serum retinol levels were monitored 	and high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of 	toxicity occured(serum retinol above 450ug/ml).  The intent of the 	study was to load the liver up with vitamin A and get a normal pool 	size(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU) and then see if this 	normal vitamin A pool could prevent PMS.  48% getting the high dose 	vitamin A had complete remission of the symptoms of PMS.  Only 10% 	getting the placebo reported getting complete relief of PMS sysmptoms.   	10% of the vitamin A treated group reported no improvement in PMS 	symptoms. 	Experimental Controlled Study, ""Premenstrual tension treated with 	vitamin A"" J. Clinical Endocrinology 10:1579-89(1950). 30 pts 	received 200,000IU of vitamin A daily starting on day 15 of their 	cycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of PMS symptoms.   	After 2-6 months, all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in 	PMS symptoms.  Vitamin A supplementation was stopped once evidence of 	toxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year 	after high dose vitamin A supplementation was stopped.  PMS symptoms 	did not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the 	vitamin A supplementation was stopped. Most Americans do not have a normal store of vitamin A in their liver. These studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal store of vitamin A into the liver could eliminate PMS.  Of all the vitamins given for PMS(vitamin A, B6, and vitamin E), vitamin A has shown the best single effect.  This is probably because vitamin A is involved in steroid (estrogen/progesterone) metabolism in the liver.  Getting your liver full of vitamin A seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent the symptoms of PMS.  But vitamin A is toxic and you don't want to be trying to do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin A toxicity. 	VITAMIN B6: Experimental Double-blind Crossoverr Study, ""Pyridoxine 	(vitamin B6) and the premenstrual syndrome: A randomized crossover 	trial""J.R. Coll. Gen. Pract. 39:364-68(1989).  32 women aged 18-49 	with moderate to severe PMS randomly received 50mg B6 daily or placebo.   	After 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another 	3 months.  B6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of 	PMS(depression, irritability and tiredness).  Other symptoms of PMS 	were not significanttly affected by B6 supplementation. 	Experimental Double-blind Study, ""The efects of vitamin B6 	supplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms"" Obstet. Gynecol 	70(2):145-49(1987).  55 pts with moderate to severe PMS received 	150mg B6 daily or placebo for 2 months.  Analysis of convergence 	showed that B6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related 	to the autonomic nervous system(dizziness and vomiting) as well as 	behavior changes(poor mental performance, decreased social interaction)   	Anxiety, depression and water retention were not improved by B6 	supplementation. Vitamin B6 is below the RDA for both American men and women.  Birth control pills and over 40 different drugs increase the B6 requirement in man. Women on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10-15 mg of B6 per day.  The dose should be increased if symptoms of PMS appear.  Dr. David R. Rubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of NIMH was quoted in Clin. Psychiatry News, December, 1987 as stating that B6 should be considered the ""first-line"" drug for PMS(over progesterone) and if the patient does not respond, then other treatments should be tried.  Vitamin B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if consumed in doses of 500mg or more each day. 	VITAMIN E: Experimental Double-blind Study, ""Efficacy of alpha- 	tocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome"" J. Reprod. 	Med. 32(6):400-04(1987). 35 pts received 400IU vitamin E daily for 3 	cycles or a placebo.  Vitamin E treated pts had 33% who reported a 	significant reduction in physical symptoms(weight gain and breast 	tenderness) while the placebo group had 14% who reported a significant  	reduction in physical symptoms. The vitamin E group reported that 38% 	had a significant reduction in anxiety versus 12% for the placebo 	group.  For depression, the vitamin E group had 27% with a significant 	decrease in depression compared with 8% for the placebo group. 	Experimental Double-blind Study, ""The effect of alpha-tocopherol on 	premenstrual symptomalogy: A double blind study"" J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 	2(2):115-122(1983). 75pts with benign breast disease and PMT randomly 	received vitamin E at 75IU, 150IU, or 300IU daily or placebo.  After 	2 months of supplementation, 150IU of vitamin E or higher significantly 	improved PMT-A and PMT-C.  The 300IU dose was needed to significantly 	improve PMT-D.  No dose of vitamin E significantly improved PMT-H 	(other studies have shown that a higher vitamin E doses will relieve 	PMT-H symptoms). 	MAGNESIUM: Experimental Double-blind Study, ""Magnesium prophylaxis 	of menstrual migraine: effects on itracellular magnesium"" Headache 	31:298-304(1991). 20 pts with perimenstrual headache received 360 mg 	daily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a 	placebo.  Treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and 	continued until menstruation. After 2 months, the Pain Total Index 	was significantly lower in the magnesium group.  Magnesium treatment 	was also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the Menstrual 	Distress Questionnaire scores.  Pretreatment magnesium levels in 	lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower 	in this group of 20 pts compared to control women who did not suffer 	from PMS.  After treatment, magnesium levels in these cells was raised 	into the normal range. 	Experimental Double-blind Study, ""Oral Magnesium successfully 	relieves premenstrual mood changes"" Obstet. Gynecol 78(2):177-81(1991). 	32pts aged 24-39 randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid 	360mg of Mg per day or a placebo from the 15th day of the cycle to the 	onset of the menstrual flow.  After 2 cycles, both groups received 	magnesium.  The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster 	pain was significantly reduced during the second cycle(month) for the 	magnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were 	switched to magnesium supplementation.  In addition, the total score on 	the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire was significantly decreased by 	magnesium supplementation.  The authors suggest that magnesium 	supplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes 	that occur during PMS. There are numerous observational studies that have been published in the medical literature which also suggest that PMS is primarily a disorder that arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature.  But since observational studies are considered by most physicians in Sci. Med. to be anecdotal in nature, I have not bothered to cite them.  There are also over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on multivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent PMS.  I've chosen the best specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out that PMS is primarily a nutritional disorder.  But doctors don't recognize nutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology(beri-beri, pellagra, scruvy, etc.).  PMS is probably the best reason why every doctor being trained in the U.S. should get a good course on human nutrition.  PMS is really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional disorders.  It's time that medicine woke up and smelled the roses. Here's some studies which show the importance in multivitamin/mineral supplementation and/or diet change in preventing PMS. 	Experimental Study, ""Effect of a nutritional programme on 	premenstrual syndrome: a retrospective analysis"", Complement. Med. 	Res.5(1):8-11(1991).  200pts were given dietary instructions and 	supplemented with Optivite(R) plus additional vitamin C, vitamin E, 	magnesium, zinc and primrose oil.  The dietary instructions were to 	take the supplements and switch to a low fat, complex carbohydrate 	diet.  On a retrospective analysis, 96.5% of the 200pts reported an 	improvement in their PMS symptoms with 30% of the sample stating that 	they no longer suffered from PMS. 	Experimental Double-blind Study, ""Role of Nutrition in managing 	premenstrual tension syndromes"", J Reprod. Med. 32(6):405-22(1987). 	A low fat, high complex carbohydrate diet along with Optivite 	supplementation significantly decreased PMS scores compared with diet 	change and placebo.  After 6 months on the experimental program, the 	vitamin/mineral supplementated group had significantly decreased 	estradiol and increased progesterone in serum during the midlutel 	phase of their cycle. 	Experimental Double-blind Study, ""Clinical and biochemical effects 	of nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome"", J. 	Reprod. Med. 32(6):435-41(1987). 119pts randomly given Optivite(12 	tablets per day) or a placebo.  The treated groups showed a 	significant decrease in PMS symptoms compared to the placebo.  Another  	group of 104pts got Optivite(4 tablets per day) or placebo.  For this 	second group of patients, no significant effect of supplementation on 	PMS symptoms was observed.

I'm very surprised that medical schools still push routine circumcision of newborn males on the population. Since your friend is not a man, she can't imagine what it's like to have a penis, much less a foreskin. I guess if American medicine did an artistic job of circumcising every male, then the visual result would be somewhat more natural in appearance... The penile cancer thing has been *completely* debunked...she must be going to school on a South Pacific island. Tell her to check the Journal or Urology for circumcision articles. I remember at least 1 on an old Jewish man (cut at birth) who developed penile cancer....I mean, if the cancer risk was that great, the Europe who have been circumcising like crazy, too. Teaching a boy how to keep his cockhead clean is the issue: a little proper hygiene goes a long way - Americans are just too hung up on the penis to consider cleaning it: that's just way too much like mastubation. So you have surgical intervention that is basically unnecessary.	other

Set the follow-up (line in the header, depending on what kind of advice you give, or (e-mail directly to me: ceci@lysator.liu.se.) I have a problem with wasps -- they seem to love me. Last summer I couldn't spend more than ten to fifteen minutes at a time in my garden before one or several wasps would come for me. I am asking for advice on how to repel wasps.    This year the wasps have built their nest under a stone next to one of my tiny ponds. The caretaker (poor fellow!) will have to take care of them, and that will give me a head start on them. Last year we couldn't find any nest. Even after the caretaker has gassed the nest in my tiny garden of 30 square meter, other wasps will most likely vie for the territory. Is there anything I can grow, rub on my skin or spread on the soil that will repel the black and yellow bastards? Never mind if it turns my skin purple or kills off all my beloved plants, I want to be able to spend time in my garden like everyone else.    Would it help to remove the ponds and the bird bath? The wasps seem to come to drink at them, and I suppose that their prey will breed in them. The black tits seem to be afraid of the wasps, because as soon as the wasp season starts, they stop coming to have their bath. Even when I am not trying to win back my patio from 15-20 wasps, they seem to love me. The advice I usually get when I ask what to do about wasps, is to stand still and not wave my arms. I've got some painful stings when trying to follow that advice. I have also tried to use hygienic products without perfumes, to no avail. They still love me, and come for me, even when I'm in the middle of a crowd. So far only two things seem to work: To kill it dead or to run into the house and close all doors and windows. NB: I don't have a problem with bees or bumble-bees, just wasps.

Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however, that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding. If you experience the problem frequently, it may be caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire, etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter. If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them). Good instructions are included with the chokes. If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things a radio operator can do to reduce interference. -- =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= Randall Rhea                                        Informix Software, Inc.

WHAT??!!!! You can't remove it, unless you register? You gotta be joking, right? What happens if I get a demo-version of that program, install it, and then decide that I don't like it.  Do I have to register to be able to get rid of it?  (Hell, no, that is the last thing I would think of!) If that is what you mean, then you would better make pretty sure, that a statement to that effect is printed loud and clear on the package! A better way to implement the above mentioned scheme is (IMHO) to allow anyone to install the program, but if they register, they get some additional features enabled.  It could mean only one new .EXE file needed to be copied, to have got the full-version of the program. Of course anyone is _free_ to _delete_ or _remove_ that program at whatever time they like. Still, we face the trouble of 'moving' the new .EXE file around.  That could be solved by having the user registering him self, and get back a specially marked for him (or her) a new .exe file. As for some sort of limitations, here are some suggestions: Limit the size of data that the program can work with, Disable saving the data, Print it out with some defects in the output (but be sure to mark them as such) Let some pop-up screen appear for ca. 10 secs. when the program is started and/or exited etc.... but DON'T have it that you _must_ register to be able to remove it. -- einari@rhi.hi.is	other

They cost ~$1 at Radio Shack (much cheaper in quantity at quality places), and you will be able to find good info about simple circuits in a 555 oscialltor notebook (I think Forest Mims has one at Radio Shack). You'll have to toy with resistor/capacitor values OR you can use your head with a little math to get the right frequencies. Any engineer worth his salt, can make a 555 osciallator... It's in the book, and left up to you to see (I hate doing ASCII circuit graphics). The 555 can accurately go from a few Hz to about 500 KHz (I think). About the Tape Recorder gizmo, you could alter a stereo tape deck to use one channel as a DATA line (for flashing LED), and one as audio line (for voice or music). This would eliminate a lot of noise. The data line is probably most easily done by some kind of PLL or bandpass filter (using just an op-amp). The 565 chip is a good PLL, and not hard to work with. However if you nothing about how a PLL works, I suggest you don't try this. Op-Amp information can also be found in the Forest Mims Radio Shack info-booklets, and the popular 741 op-amp is a snap to work with. Setting frequency and bandpass filter values are not so easy, so I would suggest the 555 method firstmost... I have no idea what this is going into, so I am really generalizing... As for manufacturing techniques, if you're only goofing with it, I suggest you breadboard the thing... No need to solder. Wire-wrap would be the next, more permanent step. And lastly, soldering/PCB making. Hope that clears things...... -squish@endor.harvard.edu	other

Transponder requires you send a pulse to another station and it returns it to you and you measure the round trip time minus the receiver time. Phase measurements require two or more transmitting stations sending the same frequency signal multiplexed in time. A receiver can pick them up and measure the phase shift between signals. Maps can be drawn that plot the Lines of Position that correspond to a certain phase shift between two stations. John Eaton !hp-vcd!johne	other

When I asked, people said that the >interpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more >complicated. You are quite correct in your understanding.  The filtering is not interpolation, as that would distort the frequency content of the signal you are listening to.  Generally, these players run the samples thru an all-pass filter network.  I have done this for ECG waveforms from a person's heart, and the effect is rather spooky.  It actually reconstructs peaks that weren't there (correctly, too!) and fills in the gaps with the properly computed values, just as if there had been a real sample taken at that point.  I use a CPU to do all the math.  It takes a decent (but not unreasonable) amount of CPU time to do this.  You can keep up with things in realtime if you write efficient code. In case you care, the filtering method uses an FIR (finite impulse response) filter.  I'd guess that CD makers use the same kind of method.  Anybody out there know the real answer?  I'd say that they use a tapped delay line with resistor/op-amp weighting to accomplish the filtering.  This strikes me as the most cost effective method for volume production runs. >Anyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the ""effective"" >sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency >antialiasing filters.

So, assuming the quality of >all other components in a CD player remained the same, oversampling should >allow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-alias >filtering. Actually, I think the only reason they do this is so that they can say that they have a marketting gimic.  I would guess that it is acutally cheaper to filter an oversampled signal than not.  You can use sloppier components and give the filter a roll-off that isn't so sharp.   It's too bad that they charge more for something that (I think) is actually less costly to build. I seriously doubt that the filters cost the same but are better.  They are built to a price spec, and that spec says ""cheap as possible!"". >					---Joel Kolstad   -dave -- Dave McMahan                            mcmahan@netcom.com                                         37N 17.382    121W 59.190"	other

It's now 6am... I'm pissed off.  Period.  Alright, I can  drive the steppers through the 3479P's; no problem (that's with the  6-wire steppers, 2 to +, and the other 4 are the phase lines).  Problem  1:  I've got some 4 wire steppers.  I put the darkest line to + and the  other 3 to the 3479P... worked, kinda.  Tried it with a printer stepper  (moves the head back and forth, 4 wires), didn't work too well.  It would  shift back and forth (use something like a 4017 instead?)  Also I've been  trying to get a bunch of NPN's to work with it... NO LUCK... tried PNP's,  still NO LUCK!!!  I don't know if I'm cursed on this or what, but I feel  my brain slowly frying with the thought of STEPPER ... ARGGG!!!          I don't know what's wrong with the transistor hook-up (to-220 pkg  type), also tryed the 2n2222-pkg type... no luck.                          I'm going to try getting some z's, and I hope you  can help me with this problem.    If someone can please help me with this soon, it would be greatly    appreciated...

Keywords: HD, controller, IDE, ESDI, disks Sender: news@IRO.UMontreal.CA Organization: Universite de Montreal Date: Sat, 17 Apr 1993 17:14:55 GMT Lines: 57 Hello all, You, the Net, are my last resort, or I'll just change my job :-) This might be a FAQ (e.g. mixing controllers) but haven't seen any. Sys: 486/33, AMI BIOS, and your run-of-the mill multi-I/O card with serials/paral/floppies and 	- IDE controller ""clone"" Gw2760-EX 		there are no jumpers affecting the HD or ctrller :-( 	- Quantum ProDrive LPS (3"" 105M type 47: 755cyl, 16hds, 17spt). Pb: I want to bring in this (2nd hand, neat price): 	- Maxtor XT-B380E (~330M, <15ms, BIOS type 1, ctrller manages 		the real geom: 1630cyl, 8hds, 52spt) 	- Western Digital WD1007V-SE1 ESDI ctrller: no floppies. 		(jumpers set IRQ 14/15, hw port addr 1F0/170, 		and BIOS addr CC00/C800, and other floppy/format stuff) Goal: have the WD ESDI as a secondary/controller and have both disks simultaneously working. Being able to boot from the ESDI too would be a nice bonus but is not expected. Ultimate goal: have room for Linux et al. Ex of scheme I have in mind: boot from IDE (HD or floppy) and mount the ESDI as root. Not booting from ESDI, or even from HD, is acceptable. I have tried numerous (all!!) combinations to no avail. They work alone, or can coexist witout hang-ups but can't access the ESDI or the IDE, depending on setup/jumpers. Useful suggestions might be: - How do I tell the BIOS setup about two ctrllers (I guess the 2nd HD is expected to hang off the same ctrller as the 1st). - Do I need some driver to make it work? - --- "" --- some new BIOS/chip for any of these cards? - do I have to buy another controller to make them HDs happy? IDE is cheaper; ESDI is hard to find and rather costly. I'm not rich or I wouldnt' try to scavenge around, so soft slns are preferred. - adapters of some sort; I can hold a soldering iron, and can change a chip or put a jumper! Also useful: - BBS or Hot-line of Western Digital. - ftp archives with relevant info. - expert stores in Toronto, Ontario area (that would be a miracle! haven't seen any really knowledgeable ppl in a while) - any hints into inner workings of the system ... - anything else that helped you in similar situations (prayers :-) ) Direct or posted replies are ok.

My current I/O card uses 8250's (correct number? The braindead ones anyway). It also controls two floppy drives, and two IDE hard drives. Ideally, I'd like to get a new multi I/O card, that had 2 serial ports with 16550's and could also control another 2 IDE HD's. It would have to have configurable addresses for both the serial ports, and the IDE controller, so it could co-exist with my existing card. Does such a beast exist?

There are five inputs signals: RD, DSR, DCD, CTS, and RI. There are many differnt null modem requiremts as dictated by the software. The IBM BIOS requires asserts DTR and RTS and then waits for both DSR and CTS before sending.  When a BIOS recieve call is made, it asserts DTR and waits for DSR to become true (times out after a while and returns with an error if DSR never becomes true).  It requires CTS to be true for sending AND recieving.  Most communications packages bypass this and replace it with their own protocol.  The key is that each comm. package could very well have different requirements. My favorite cable works in many cases: short RTS to CTS at each end, but also run RTS through to DCD at the opposite end.  TD runs through to RD and DTR runs through to DSR from both DTE's and of course SG goes through to SG. I have never had trouble with this null modem even though I have used it with a comm. package that was expecting RTS to go to CTS instead of DCD. The advantage of this cable is that it also works with the IBM BIOS. Gordon Lang	other

The first of which is a CMF voice editor which is hopefully going to be available soon (as soon as I can get it to an FTP site). Anyway the next stage is to use the midi port to enter music and play the FM synth remotely. The problem is that I have little or no info on the SB midi port. I have tried using the Sound blaster freedom project routines, however this just results in the port locking after a couple of accesses and loss the of note velocity data byte. I am using Turbo C and would be grateful for any info or source fragments may help. When I was in Berlin this summer I saw a book which seemed to have all this information, but my German is poor to say the least, if anyone has this book could they please mail me. My second request for help concerns standard file formats (how can a file format be standard if you keep it secret ?) I need to know the file format for instrument bank files *.BNK and Roland music files *.ROL. Finally does anyone have a source for displaying PCX or GIF files to EGA or VGA monitors. Please Help, You know it makes sense. Colin	other

(formerly IMSL and Precision Visuals) is in the process of securing sites for beta testing X Exponent Graphics 1.0 and C Exponent Graphics 2.0.  (Both X Exponent Graphics and C Exponent Graphics are 3GL products).  The beta period is from April 26 through June 18.  The platform is HP9000/700 running under OS 8.07 with ansi C 8.71 compiler.  The media will be sent on 4mm DAT cartridge tape.  Here are some of the key facts about the two products. X Exponent Graphics 1.0 key facts: 1. Complete collection of high-level 2D and 3D application plot types    available through a large collection of X resources. 2. Cstom widget for OSF/Motif developers. 3. Built-in interactive GUI for plot customization. 4. Easily-implemented callbacks for customized application feedback. 5. XEG 1.0, being built on the Xt Toolkit provides the user a widget    library that conforms to the expected syntax and standards familar    to X programmers. 6. XEG will also be sold as a bundle with Visual Edge's UIM/X product.    This will enable user to use a GUI builder to create the graphical    layout of an application. C Exponent Graphics 2.0 key facts: 1. Written in C for C application programmers/developers.  The library    is 100% written in C, and the programming interface conforms to C    standards, taking advantage fo the most desirable features of C. 2. Build-in GUI for interactive plot customization.  Through mouse    interaction, the user has complete interactive graph output control    with over 200 graphics attributes for plot customization. 3. Large collection of high-level application functions for ""two-call""    graph creation.  A wide variety of 2D and 3D plot types are available    with minimal programming effort. 4. User ability to interrupt and control the X event.  By controlling    the X event loop, when the user use the mouse to manipulate the  plot    the user can allow CEG to control the event loop or the user can    control the event loop. If anyone is interested in beta testing either of the products, please contact Wendy Hou at Visual Numerics via email at hou@imsl.com or call 713-279-1066. -- Jaclyn Brandt jbrandt@NeoSoft.com --"	other

On my SVR4 Amiga Unix box, I've got -lform, -lmenu, and -lpanel for use with the curses library.  Guess what they provide? :-) Unix Press, ie. Prentice-Hall, has a programmer's guide for these tools, referred to as the FMLI (Forms Mgmt Language Interface) and ETI (Extended Terminal Interface), now in it's 2nd edition.  It is ISBN 0-13-020637-7. Paraphrased from the outside back cover:     FMLI is a high-level programming tool for creating menus, forms,     and text frames.  ETI is a set of screen management library     subroutines that promote fast development of application programs     for window, panel, menu, and form manipulation. The FMLI is a shell package which reads ascii text files and produces screen displays for data entry and presentation.  It consists of a ""shell-like"" environment of the ""fmli"" program and it's database files.  It is section 1F in the Unix Press manual. The ETI are subroutines, part of the 3X manual section, provide support for a multi-window capability on an ordinary ascii terminal with controls built on top of the curses library. >Thanks >-Mark Steele >steelem@rintintin.colorado.edu -- Frank ""Crash"" Edwards          Edwards & Edwards Consulting Voice: 813/786-3675            crash%ckctpa@myrddin.sybus.com, but please Data:  813/787-3675            don't ask UUNET to route it -- it's sloooow.

Sender: news@news.unomaha.edu (UNO Network News Server) Organization: University of Nebraska at Omaha Date: Wed, 21 Apr 1993 19:38:12 GMT Lines: 227 	------------------------------------- 	+ ............The OTIS Project '93  + 	+ ""The Operative Term Is STIMULATE"" + 	------------------------------------- 	---this file last updated..4-21-93--- WHAT IS OTIS? OTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork and photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny, and distribution.  Digital immortality. The basic idea behind ""digital immortality"" is that computer networks are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the artifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they'll be put in different formats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll be there...and someone will dig them up. If that doesn't interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is breathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons. Spectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and let the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own copies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption... that's what they're here for. --------------------------------------------------------------- WHERE? OTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.  	141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site 	sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite 	(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well) Merely ""anonymous FTP"" to either site on Internet and change to the appropriate directory.  Don't forget to get busy and use the ""bin"" command to make sure you're in binary. OTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North America....the following systems have a substancial supply of OTIStuff... 	Underground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines 	CyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron -------------------------------------------------------------- HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE? What happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely photo, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put it in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me (email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received, it will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works are also welcome. OTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG. GIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to see.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at most large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit tougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer, you can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change JPG files to a standard GIF format. OTIS also accepts animation files. When you submit image files, please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people to view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll be having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of emailing). If you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send copies to: The OTIS Project c/o Ed Stastny PO BX 241113 Omaha, NE 68124-1113 I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will scan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back. Also include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to what the images are to be named, include those as well. Conversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please contact me and we'll arrange things. If you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5"" disk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back. This is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP, but do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM compatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or JPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather not have to. At senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they can stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send a blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to get a slab-o-OTIS. As of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing. Email me for current archive size and directory. -------------------------------------------------------------------- DISTRIBUTION? The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to another).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local bulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the appropriate text files along with the images. It would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images from OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is. It's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as possible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite BBS system....or even just post this ""info-file"" there.  It would be keen of you. -------------------------------------------------------------------- USE? If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory, you'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or full address credit).  You will either find this in the "".rm"" file for the image or series of images...or in the ""Artists"" directory under the Artists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have to contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email me (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for you, or give you their contact information. When you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist know about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files. --------------------------------------------------------------------- NAMING IMAGES? Please keep the names of your files in ""dos"" format.  That means, keep the filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or four digit ""code"" for the series of images, plus the series number. Thus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something like: 	ldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC Keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- CREATING IMAGE FILES? When creating image files, be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in case they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title, address or other information you'd like people to know. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HMMM?! That's about it for now.  More ""guidelines"" will be added as needed. Your input is expected. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS  	     (a sumerian deity) or it's followers, be they pope, priest, 	     or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations 	     however. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original  	     image files.  The files will go to the public at large. 	     It's possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone 	     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.     	     Unless you've given permission for that, it's illegal.  OTIS 	     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights 	     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to 	     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed 	     electronically.  If you don't want your images distributed 	     all-over, don't upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is 	     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or 	     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not 	     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software, 	     screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific 	     permission for this sort of usage. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Remember, the operative term is ""stimulate"".  If you know of people that'd be interested in this sort of thing...get them involved...kick'm in the booty....offer them free food...whatever... ....e  (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu)        (ed@sunsite.unc.edu) -- Ed Stastny           | OTIS Project, END PROCESS, SOUND News and Arts PO BX 241113	     | FTP: sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS) Omaha, NE 68124-1113 |      141.214.4.135 (projects/otis) ---------------------- EMail: ed@cwis.unomaha.edu, ed@sunsite.unc.edu"	other

[Deleted for space; basically complaints that xv is an 8 bit program and that making several modifications to the RGB sliders is slow because of screen updates.] In reverse order: 1) Try clicking in the auto-apply box to switch it off. Then make your mods. Then click on apply. There is no problem as stated; it has already been solved if you look carefully. 2) Yes XV is an 8 bit program. This is not a bug. You can edit individual pallette entries or do global colour changes; crop, scale etc. Clearly the program must save out the *altered* image else all your work would be thrown away. So yes it saves out 8 bit images - of course! XV can import 24 bit images and quantises them down to 8 bits. This is a handy facility, not a bug. How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more complicated. If you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image, you need much more powerfull software - which is readily available commercially. And lastly, JPEG is a compression algorithm. It can be applied to any image of arbitrary bit depth. Again, this is not a bug. It is a way of saving disk space ;-) Later, -- Chris Lilley ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Technical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project Computer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK.

(like ripple, explode, bounce) things of that nature.  Also it has algorithmic texture maps....and your standard brushmapping also... you can have animated brushmaps...(ie. live video mapped on the objs)... also animated backdrops (ie. live video backgrounds) also animted reflections maps.... you get the idea.... it will run for about 500$ retail (I think)... dont let the low price fool you.... this product can do it all when it comes to 3D-animation and Renderering...! also....does anyone here know how to get in the Imagine mailing list?? please e-mail me if you do or post up here.... oh...the number for IMPULSE is --->1 800 328 0184 trb3@ra.msstate.edu	other

But unfortunately I was looking for the same graphics feature described in this book but _NOT_ in 640x480x16 or 320x200x256 mode. It is easy to accomodate all the pixel ""descriptor"" (or color attributes) in those modes into A0000-AFFFFF, but not in 640x480x256(which is what I am interested in).  I haven't finish the book but I affraid the author didn't talk much about this mode(or other SVGA modes).  If anyone out there know any good book dealing with fast SVGA graphics manupulation(scrolling, repainting, all other good stuff..) please send me mail.  Programming guide to SVGA card is also welcome. 	Thanks in advance. ************************************************************************ *                         Tiang   T.

Asante EN/SC adapter. The 10Base-T connection works like a charm. I installed the newest drivers from Asante's ftp server. The problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain - specifically a 50MB drive. I power up the drive, then the Mac. The Mac tests memory, etc. Just before the ""happy Mac face"" normally shows up, the power light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use the network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the Asante box pretty much unusable. It doesn't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn on the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn't get noticed during the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter works, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has *never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I've had it for over a year). Here is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID's of the EN/SC and the disk -- several permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at the head or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator (both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal resistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying another identical drive; trying several different SCSI cables. Has anybody seen this? More importantly, does anyone have a solution? Thanks a lot.

[as well as showing you that if you don't have a > marketing department to speak of, no one will care how good your system is] I've had the same experience actually. I love the Mac interface and any number of the features, but am sorely dissapointed with the speed. I use macs daily and am a Moc consultant for OSU Statistics department; I'm familiar with almost every model out there, and my experience is that both the Amiga and the Atari ST simply ""blow the Mac out of the water"" in terms of performance. At this time I would in general say that the other advantages of the Mac outweigh the advantages of the Amiga or the ST (and Falcon), but I really wish Apple would get their heads together on speed... :-((((( They could take a real lesson in muli-tasking from the Amiga OS or the MultiTOS in the Atari Falcons too :-(((  > I'm still happy with my ci, but I don't understand why the performance is > so bad (comparatively).  They could have done multi-tasking _properly_. > They could have done everthing else better -- but apple didn't. > (of course DOS 6 and windows 3.1 are nothin to write home about either!!) I just hope that someone comes out with a machine that does *everything* well someday. If I had my choice, I would go with Mac in most aspects, but add the speed and superior Multi-Tasking of the other platforms. As for the original topic; Trying to compare *just the chip* in a machine seems almost worthless. A fast 386 with a wiz-bang graphics accelerator will be faster in productivity for many applications than a even a stock Quadra. Add a graphics accelerator to a 486 and you *really fly*. Of course, add one the the Quadra and then you're blowing the 486 away... etc... > Oh well, y'all got $2.00 worth for the price of $0.02 I think mine was only worth $0.01....... ----------------------------------------------------------------------> |-! -David Butler- dhbutler@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu   ""This is not a novel to be tossed away lightly;    it should be thrown with great force.""         -Dorothy Parker"	other

""I have been closely following for two weeks the withdrawal of Russians and  Armenians from Turkish territories through Armenia. Although two months  have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs, I  have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at  almost every step. All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from  Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly  slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to  save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful  events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then  taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people  well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these  places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun.  They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the  Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality  problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers  who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and  Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the  Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs.  I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is  destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air. Although there are  speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as  well, I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard, but there is  proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war.""

It was for the purpose of establishing a state, not an exclusive state.  If the state was to be exclusive, it would not have 400 000 arab citizens. 	And no, I do not consider the purchase of land a hostile action.  When someone wants to buy land, and someone else is willing to sell it, at a mutually agreeable price, then that is commerce.  It is not a hostile action leading to war. >As to whether the Jews wanted to live in peace, maybe. >However they wanted and still want an exclusively Jewish >state, where Jews are in control and Jews are the masters of >the land.

Try again, you tell me what its isn't, but you fail to establish what it is. 	Also, Jews did have history in Israel for over a thousand years.  There were lots of Jews slaughtered by Crusaders in Israel. There was a thriving community in Gaza city from roughly 1200-1500. Jews were a majority in Jerusalem from 1870 or so onwards.  Does that make the land Jewish?

All your article reflects is your abundant ignorance. The people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July 15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop Makarios. Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with the aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right given by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently and conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island since 1571. The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the 'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences for this irresponsible conduct.             THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM 2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus It is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched against the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally killed in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage Greeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the 24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which has been converted into a museum. AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY GREEK TERRORISTS The date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the Greeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been going on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage bloodshed... The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent, are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the bathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their home. A glaring example of Greek barbarism. Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by Mr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded during the same terrible event. ""On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan. Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs. Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting having supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River direction started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain. Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was dangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought would be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We waited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing in the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her arms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open. Greeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house with  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard voices saying, in  Greek, ""You want Taksim eh!""  and then bullets started flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children fell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks, who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I heard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted. When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and her three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what had happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to the  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was brutally murdered. In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying ""Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?""  I became terrified. I thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not dead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself under the double-bed. An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My mouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some water. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the bathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I offered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who were all wounded. We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I thought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed to be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber and I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked as far as Koshklu Chiftlik. There, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were operated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs. Ayshe and her daughter. After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to Ankara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months treatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus, Greeks arrested me at the Airport. All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my detention. They then released me."" ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in which 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five days. We  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some terrible sights. In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A child's bicycle lay in a corner. In the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three children piled on top of their murdered mother. In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the head. This, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose family had been killed by the mob in the first violence. Today was five days later, and still they lay there. Rene MacCOLL and Daniel McGEACHIE, (From the ""DAILY EXPRESS"") ""...I saw in  a bathroom the bodies of a  mother and three infant children murdered because their father was a Turkish Officer..."" Max CLOS, LE FIGARO 25-26 January, 1964  Peter Moorhead reporting from the village of Skyloura, Cyprus.  Date : 1 January, 1964.  IL GIARNO (Italy)  THEY ARE TURK-HUNTING, THEY WANT TO EXTERMINATE THEM.  Discussions start in London; in Cyprus terror continues. Right now we  are witnessing the exodus of Turks from the villages. Thousands of people  abandoning homes, land, herds; Greek Cypriot terrorism is relentless. This  time, the rhetoric of the Hellenes and the bust of Plato do not suffice to  cover up barbaric and ferocious behaviors.  Article by Giorgo Bocca, Correspondent of Il Giorno  Date: 14 January 1964  DAILY HERALD (London)  AN APPALLING SIGHT And when I came across the Turkish homes they were an appalling sight. Apart from the walls, they just did not exist. I doubt if a napalm bomb attack could have created more devastation. I counted 40 blackened brick and concrete shells that had once been homes. Each house had been deliberately fired by petrol. Under red tile roofs which had caved in, I found a twisted mass of bed springs, children's conts and cribs, and ankle deep grey ashes of what had once been chairs, tables and wardrobes. In the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios, a mile away, I counted 16 wrecked and burned out homes. They were all Turkish Cypriot homes. From this village more than 100 Turkish Cypriots had also vanished.In neither village did I find a scrap of damage to any Greek Cypriot house.  DAILY TELEGRAPH (London)  GRAVES OF 12 SHOT TURKISH CYPRIOTS FOUND IN CYPRUS VILLAGE  Silent crowds gathered tonight outside the Red Crescent hospital in the  Turkish Sector of Nicosia, as the bodies of 9 Turkish Cypriots found  crudely buried outside the village of Ayios Vassilios, 13 miles away, were  brought to the hospital under the escort of the Parachute Regiment. Three  more bodies, including one of a woman, were discovered nearby but could  not be removed. Turkish Cypriots guarded by paratroops are still trying to  locate the bodies of 20 more believed to have been buried on the same site.

We had a most peculiar little locomotive, originally built in America for the Russian Government, adapted to burn either wood or oil; one covered truck as men's quarters; one similar, which I fitted up for my- self and a railway officer; and also a truck to carry wood, three cars being the utmost our small engine could pull. With this small outfit we started, rumours of all kinds reaching us before our departure indicating that the whole situation was rapidly coming to a head, it being evident that the Turks were becoming~ more and more restive in the face of the inexplicable delay of the Allies in reaching any definite decision with regard to the future. Travelling on this little ""war-time"" railway was indeed an experience, and it was necessary to carry a ""gauge,"" and to test the rails with it frequently, for in many places, owing to the sinking of the embankments and the washing away of the ballast, the rails required rectification before we were able to get our train over, even at a foot pace; each bridge also re- quired elaborate examination before adventuring the train upon it, and eventually we were obliged to carry large baulks of tim- ber to temporarily shore up many of the bridges and culverts whilst we passed over them. Under these circumstances it may be imagined that our prog- ress was by no means rapid, and as we had frequently to halt also to replenish our supply of wood fuel, we considered we had achieved wonders when, on the evening of the second day, 60 hours and 70 miles out from Erzeroum, we finally entered the gorge of the mountains where we understood our worst troubles to lie. This is the same gorge into which the road from Erzeroum to Kars descends from the foot-hills to cross the frontier; the railway, however, follows the main Aras River val- ley till the frontier gorge enters it, whilst the road cuts off the corner and joins the rail again at the frontier post of Zivin, some 15 miles from the main valley. Soon after entering the gorge, we were confronted by the first serious fall of rock--about 2,000 tons having fallen from the cliff face and entirely obliterated the railway track.

The reasons are pragmatic: even if >Bosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under >Turkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has any >clue what was their ancestor's actual nationality.  In fact, although I am forced to disagree with you. First of all, one may have been born from a non-Turkish, non-Muslim parent outside the Turkish land, yet still can be a Turk, provided this person calls himself or herself a Turk. Because the designation of a Turk is not a genetic feature, not a racial or religious feature. It is a matter of identifying with the Turkish values. Secondly, the following observations by Westerners were written in French by Ahmet Cevat: ""If Turks had behaved like Christians to use force to convert to Islam the nations which they brought under their power, to which no one could have opposed, today there would be no Eastern problem. But Turks did not do so. They obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody ""to worship in their own way"" centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus, in an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when people in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs differed from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the inquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and where accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkey was the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere by the Christians, could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslim countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian countries.""[1] ""The Turks, who are a conquering nation, did not Turkify the nations that came under their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions. It was a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of Russian or Austrian rule. Because otherwise there would not have been a Romanian nation today"" (Popescu Ciocanel). ""Turks rule over people under their administration only externally, without interfering with their internal structures. On account of this, the autonomy of minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most advanced European countries.""[2] ""...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. This flaw is older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examples of this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account of his religion. If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of simple contempt among us too, or if it did not keep translating itself into action, many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves happy!"" (A. de Mortraye).[3] ""Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the inquisition. On the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunate victims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history, you will see that in the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and Portugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years, and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the cruelty of Christians, especially that of the Orthodoxes. No Jew is able to appear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens, even today. In Turkey, however, if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities, local courts immediately take them under their protection."" ""In that vast and calm country of the sultan, all religions and nations are living together peacefully. Although the mosque is superior to the church and the synagogue, it does not replace them. Because of this, the Catholic sect is more free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon. In addition to the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this sect, neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While the dead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processional candles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches in the Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical processions during the Eucharist celebrations, chanting hymns and bearing their crosses and religious banners, a detachment of soldiers escorts them which forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of priests.""

The U.S. is subsidizing Israels existance and the Europeans are not (at least not to the same degree). So I think that might be a reason they report more clearly on the atrocities. 	What is a shame is that in Austria, daily reports of the inhuman acts commited by Israeli soldiers and the blessing received from the Government makes some of the Holocaust guilt go away.

Well, apparently we have another son of Dro 'the Butcher' to contend with. You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries. If you feel that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed. This is not a lecture to another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist, but a fact. I will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line, lie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide. We are neither in x-Soviet Union, nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship, that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest. Also, feel free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists, the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian criminal organizations. Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. You, and those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up. Not a chance.

Followup-To: soc.culture.turkish Sender: news@anatolia.org Message-ID: <9304161845@zuma.UUCP> Date: Fri, 16 Apr 93 18:45:41 EDT Reply-To: sera@zuma.UUCP (Serdar Argic) Distribution: world Lines: 72 The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians 78 years ago in x-Soviet Armenia is being reenacted again - this time in Azerbaijan. The stories of survivors of Karabag massacre are in 'Milliyet' today. 69 year old Hatin Nine telling: -''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They told me: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.'' 72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu: - ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours.   While killing children and babies mercilessly they said: You are   Turks, you must die.'' 28 year old Gulsum Huseyin: - ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of     my eyes.'' Are these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming? Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region? The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British Journalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times article. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before Turkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures of people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off. Even the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these ""lies."" They are saying ""exaggeration."" That means ''somethings'' have happened but the situation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu town was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's 3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach... The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of this massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word. Some of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre. Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print no news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the French TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag was ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.'' The age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots of organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human rights violations. International reactions must be made with international cooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming to be civilized. Could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the right to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where is the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals, journalists, writers, TV stations of certain western countries such as France who are fast to claim leadership of ""human rights?"" Where are you?

A gun kills people. Rather, people kill people with guns.  The sad truth is: sometimes that is good, or at least, better than the alternative. >But let's ignore guns for defence and/or crime and look at gun accidents. Ok.  There are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [1], and the number has been in decline since early this century [2].  Most of these accidents involve rifles or shot guns, not handguns. ... >But seriously: a gun is designed to fire a bullet.   This is not so you >can shoot cardboard cut outs down at the range. In fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that. The idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliber handgun) was designed to kill or hurt people, even for self defense, would, I'm sure, come as a surprise to its designer.  It certainly isn't why I have it.  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it, and might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to kill people. >This is not designed to act as a tool for home  defence where you show >someone  that you have a gun and they go ""Gee, perhaps I should leave"". In fact, that is what happens most of the time.  Most self defensive uses of firearms don't involve firing any shots.  Most criminals would prefer not to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing what you say when you point a gun at them. If you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, to immediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  A handgun is about the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work the best.[3] >No, you see the gun was designed to fire that little bullet into a human >body and hurt them.  Not a tough concept to swallow, for most. Certainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing) aren't deadly weapons.  However, it simply isn't true to say that all of them were designed to kill people.  Moreover, what exactly is wrong with having deadly weapons?  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to use deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  I consider it not just my right, but my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and knowing how to use the tools to do that. ""The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government."" 	- T. Jefferson. I think what Jefferson said is still true. >And the trouble with having such an item is often the little bullet goes >off into the wrong fleshy target. Not very often compared to other use.[3] >Or else Uncle Frank gets pissed and blows  away his wife. This isn't that common either, at least when compared to other uses.  It is very rare that a non-violent person will suddenly ""get-pissed"" and kill someone, gun or not.  In most cases, the people who murder have long histories of violence.  If you have good reason to believe that these people wouldn't kill if they didn't have a gun, feel free to present it. >Having a thing  specificly designed to kill means it is much easier to >kill things.  Right? Right, but there are times when killing things is called for.  I hope I never have to shoot a person, but I've had to kill a number of animals from rodents to cows, and when I do, I don't want them to suffer any more than is necessary.  I prefer they die instantly, but failing that, I want them to drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that, I don't want them to go fast or far.  I try to choose the best weapon and ammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I'm after, but it doesn't always work as I plan.  Without belaboring the point, people who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns, particularly handguns, haven't used them much for that purpose.

In 1932, the accidental deaths by firearm per 1,000,000 people was 24.03. In 1987, it was 5.74. The decline has been steady, consistent, and a fairly straight line when plotted. At the rate of the last sixty years, it will reach zero sometime around 2025 AD. CONCLUSION ========== Firearms have been a declining factor in accidental deaths for over sixty years, despite rising per-capita gun ownership. [1] = Year. [2] = Population. [3] = Accidental deaths.

If this were so, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide would be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in cities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would show a higher fatality rate.  But the Nat'l Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this not to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife attacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks (which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants), the proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the proportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true. What was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on the part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended to show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave physical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the head neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this pattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of rage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.

There are a lot of factors which make a difference.  Actually, I'm not fond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and Americans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic differences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found myself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I don't think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent crime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every law-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi. On the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more culturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive, seven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates of Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities with roughly the same population, urban economy, geography and crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control. In Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After a 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed weapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted. In Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason to purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted. Recreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are regulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a restricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in order to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns transported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box. In short, gun control but not unreasonably so. Both cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for gun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers studied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated), burglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from 1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the same standard: the FBI's Unified Crime Report. Results: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver (1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99). 18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in Vancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 / 1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher (1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by weapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged. Although both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated assault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were far more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often. Over the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle (11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000). After adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations, the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as compared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63. When homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate of homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in Seattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver. Virtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to a more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns accounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns were 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than in Vancouver. The authors of the report also investigated ""legally justifiable"" homicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during the seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only 21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in Seattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After excluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these earlier findings. ------- This is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make the argument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because Vancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times that of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports annual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC, Chicago, Los Angeles and Houston. Critics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access to handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because persons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a gun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently. If the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by the strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we could expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to be higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the study interval, Vancouver's rate of homicide by weapons other than guns was not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that few would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods. As well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding citizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did experience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these cases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities during the course of the study period.  And, as was reported, Seattle apparently didn't enjoy relief from any crime category over Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for self-defense.

If |> Jesus did in fact command his disciples to arm themselves, I would |> take that as yet another reason to reject Christian doctrine, for |> whatever it's worth. |> Let me clarify.  In order to more clearly understand scripture, one must look in the context of where the verse is found.  The section you refer to here is found in Luke 22.  I'd like to start back at verse 35 and I'll include it here for the sake of completeness:    Then Jesus asked them, ""When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals,    did you lack anything?""    ""Nothing."" the disciples replied. Verse 36 says:  ""But now, if you have a purse take it and also a bag; and     if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.  It is written,     ""And he was numbered with the transgressors."" Verse 38 says:  The disciples said, ""See, Lord, here are two swords.""                 ""That is enough.""  he replied. What does this all mean? In verse 35, Jesus points out to the disciples that when he sent them out previously, they did not need to take anything with them.  Their food, lodging and transport were often provided through the generosity of others. If verse 36, Jesus alludes to the change in attitude that is to come in the near future.  Remember, Jesus was saying these things shortly before he was to be arrested.  In verse 36, He tells the disciples that they will have to take their own possessions and provisions with them.  THey will have to carry their own purse because there will be no longer any generosity from anyone.  And there will be times of peril when they will have to take care of themselves.  This was implied by the reference to the sword.  Jesus knew that He was going to be arrested and labeled as a criminal.  The charges brought against Him were likely to be passed on to his disciples. In verse 38, we see that the disciples have taken Jesus too literally.  It is not the first time that the disciples got His message wrong.  They had done this on several occassions.  Instead of understanding the gist of His words, they presented Him with two swords.  Jesus was perhaps taken aback by this promptly concludes the discussion by saying, ""That is enough."" The disciples could not understand why Jesus had to die.  Jesus kept telling them over and over again that He would soon not be with them but they could not grasp this.  They wanted their Messiah to be a political leader who would lead them in rebellion against the Romans.  That is why they were so keen on presenting Him with the swords.  They had no idea that Jesus was referring to a different kingdom of which they were to be a part of.  The disciples could only perceive of a kingdom on earth rather than the one in Heaven. Understand that Jesus NEVER intended his followers to take up arms in rebellion. This was clearly in evidence in Luke 22:51 when Jesus rebuked his disciples for using the sword against the servant of the high priest when they came to arrest Him.  As further evidence, Jesus goes so far as to heal the man injured by the disciples.  Jesus did NOT condone violence as a means for His purpose. Contrast this behaviour with that of David Koresh and you will clearly see that DK was NOT Jesus as he claimed.  Jesus surrendered himself to the authourities and allowed himself to be crucified.  He didn't go out in a blaze of glory, but rather Jesus was executed like a common criminal. I hope this makes it a little more clear.

Canada has been blaming the U.S. for their problems for years. The simple fact of the matter is this:  Ten years ago they crowed about how great their system was because they'd gotten rid of the guns and the U.S. would be so much better if they'd just get into the divine light shining from the North.  We pointed out that it was cultural differences, and pointed to their pre-control crime rates.  We also pointed out that the history of the entire world contained smuggling, and that whenever something was wanted, it was smuggled in.        If the problem were based on U.S. guns, it would have surfaced years before.        Now more Canadian criminals want guns.  And they are being provided. Canada has its own version of the drug problem.  Yet drugs are prohibited in the U.S. >Hell, here in Britain, the cops don't even carry guns.

Delta Force?  The BATF had more than enough equipment and men.  They did not have good intel, but they did have poor planning.  They fucked up.  Even in just the most basic military sense, they fucked up.  Excuses do not justify body counts. >The BATF needs more people, better weapons and more armored >transports.

And your excuses fall upon deaf ears when the same BATF has shown shitty leadership despite more people, better weapons, and exclusive use of armor against their targets.  BATF is nothing more than a private army of the government.  Do the agents swear an oath, as I did, to uphold the Constitution?  You know, that document that stipulates the highest law of the land?  If they do, they should be up for charges in a court of law.  Remember, the law?  That's the whole reason for any of this. >With the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is needed >more now then ever.

Mind if I sight in my guns on your body?  Think of it as the price you have to pay that we may all live without fear of my making a stray shot.  It's fine and dandy to revel in the other guy being the target and your supposed safety.  In the military, we called this ""chicken shit.""  Leadership from the rear. The War on Drugs, despite being a catchy term for nothing more than a continuation of policy since before this century, seems to have gotten you convinced that my rights aren't worth your good vibes. Mind if I cut your net access, as well as access to any and all forms of expression?  See, you make me nervous, what with you being able to influence so many.  I'm sure you can see how this is the price we have to pay for freedom and liberty in this country, as well as a fair and unbiased judiciary. >With the arms build up in Waco they needed to hit that compound with >mega fire power. They could of gone in there blasting and killed a few >women and kids but it would of been better then letting them all burn >to death 51 days later. 	Mind if we include you in the body count?  I'm sure we could all file it under ""civic improvement"" and your life wouldn't have been sacrificed in vain.  If you like, you can will your estate to defecit reduction, too.  Now, when you learn how the law protects, or doesn't protect, everybody equally and how our collective boot may one day be on your collective throat, perhaps at that time you will mature enough to realize just what you're talking about and how serious this is.

A problem occurs when I try to create a window with a visual that is different from the visual of the parent (which uses the default visual which is TC24). In the Xlib reference guide from 'O reilly one can read in the section about XCteateWindow, something like: ""In the current implementation of X11: When using a visual other than the parent's, be sure to create or find a suitable colourmap which is to be used in the window attributes when creating, or else a BadMatch occurs."" This warning, strangely enough, is only mentioned in the newer editions of the X11R5 guides. However, even if I pass along a suitable colourmap, I still get a BadMatch when I create a window with a non-default visual. The code looks like this: ------------------ cut here and you'll destroy your CRT ---------------- Window create_8bit_window_on_truecolour_display(dpy,width,height) Display *dpy; int width, height; {   Window win;   XVisualInfo vinfo;   XSetWindowAttributes attr;   fprintf(stderr,""Opening 8 bit window...\n"");   if (!XMatchVisualInfo(dpy,DefaultScreen(dpy),8,PseudoColor,&vinfo)) {     fprintf(stderr,""Your display can't handle 8 bit PseudoColor.\n"");     exit(1);   }   fprintf(stderr,""Using visual: %x\n"",vinfo.visual->visualid);   cmap = XCreateColormap(            dpy,            DefaultRootWindow(dpy),            vinfo.visual,            AllocNone          );   XSync(dpy,False);   XInstallColormap(dpy,cmap);	/* ommision of this line gives same result */   attr.colormap = cmap;   win = XCreateWindow(           dpy,           DefaultRootWindow(dpy),           10,10,           width,height,           CopyFromParent,       /* border width */           8,                    /* depth */           InputOutput,          /* class */           vinfo.visual,         /* visual */           CWColormap,           &attr         );   return win; } --- cut here and you'll destroy your CRT ----- Executing this piece of code results in a BadMatch error.

Since the dialog is modal, mwm won't allow keyboard focus onto your main shell, and so it won't allow cmap focus either. Since it sounds as though you have keyboardFocusPolicy:pointer, I suggest you set colormapFocusPolicy:pointer also.  That way, the cmap focus won't slavishly follow keyboard focus, but will beat its own path. (if you have keyboardFocusPolicy: explicit, you can set cmap focus explicit also, but you then need a binding to f.focus_color, probably on MB1). -- David Brooks					dbrooks@osf.org Open Software Foundation			uunet!osf.org!dbrooks Showres soote my foote"	comp.windows.x

""multi-screen"" and ""multi-display"" would, if taken strictly, mean different things, but since the strict meaning of ""multi-display"" would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and pointers, when it's used it probably refers to the same thing ""multi-screen"" would: a system that provides multiple Screens.

There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at most 255 Screens.  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays on a single invocation, unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can be looked upon as such; on a TCP-based system there is necessarily a limit of 65535 Displays per machine, but this is not a limitation inherent to X. What you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular implementation (probably the MIT one).

I decided to implement an animated cursor (using 6 created cursors) by calling XDefineCursor from a SIG_ALRM signal handler. This is used to indicate we are waiting for a operator request to complete. (on a production control system). I was redrawing the screen underneath the animated cursor and then restoring the standard cursor when complete. I found dumped core , and upon analysis it was when the SIG_ALRM handler was called during a XDrawString call. XDrawString was doing a bcopy (presumably an internal structure) when the XDefineCursor was called. Presumably the (internal) structure that XDrawString was manipulating was not in a stable state and sent XDefineCursor to where it shouldn't have been. Has anyone else experienced this?

Anyway, what you say is not really true. The color information is associated with a GraphicsContext, not with a display, and the GC _IS_ a parameter to the drawing routines. So, if you need to fast switch between green dotted lines and blue ones of width 2, you can make 2 GCs for those cases and then simply do XDrawLine(dpy,win,gc_red,x1,y1,x2,y2); XDrawLine(dpy,win,gc_blue,x3,y3,x4,y4); for this effect. This is eventually more complicated to do for the programmer, but also much more efficient and flexible. You would not include all the other parameters like line pattern, with, cap and joinstyle, drawmode and so on in every drawing call, so why do it for color ? BTW, stay away from XDrawPoint() if you don't really need it (to draw RANDOM points), for image transfers there are Image routines. -- +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+ | o |                \\\-  Brain Inside -///                       | o | | o |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           | o | | o | Andre' Beck (ABPSoft) mehl: Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de | o | +-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+	comp.windows.x

The IAEA has two conflicting goals.  One is to promote the spread of nuclear energy, the other to police its use.  Any successful policing, ie, finding cheaters, shows that its other arm is being overzealous in its promotion of nuclear energy. 	The IAEA announces in advance which sites it will visit.  It allows the country it is inspecting to veto areas on the list, by claiming they are not used for nuclear work.  Its inspectors are drawn from all over the world, and few have any experience in bomb building. Such experience would make the job of determining if a site was being used for military purposes much easier. 	Unfortunately, many countries object to knowledgeable inspectors, because the only really knowledgeable inspectors come from about 10 countries. 	There was an excelent article on the Feb 1 1993 New Yorker on why the IAEA fails to do its job.

In fact, it is the fact that hospitals frequently compete for physicians rather than for patients that (in part) complicates and undermines a simplistic free-market analysis of the market for medical care. >Hospitals tend to lose money on all sorts of high-tech, high-price >machinery. They manage to make it up on other charges. Once again, there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidney dialysis.  Although price controls have promoted an expansion of services to a much greater volume of patients, RD is still a profitable service. Otherwise, one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than the vast expansion that has occurred. > >> Remember, the notion that you can lose a little on each treatment but >> make it up in volume is not good economics even in a free market. :) > >Then how do you explain why grocery stores routinely offer an >array of products at prices below cost?  Are not grocery stores >embedded in a relatively free market? Can you spell ""loss leader?""  I knew you could.  Grocery stores do not attempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of it.  In fact, your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader for other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained. But the evidence does not support this contention.  Rather, it appears that price controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of service and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide comparable benefits.  Providers continue to profit from RD, they simply make less on each treatment than they would have if the price had risen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have. There is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD substantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday predictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restriction of service, lagging technological development, etc.  Likewise, it appears that in the VA and armed forces medical care systems, where providers are government agencies, some of these negative impacts may occur. (RD patients in the VA system in Spokane, for example, must travel to Seattle, 300 miles away, for treatment.) The bottom line, however, is that this is an example of government intervention (of a rather extreme sort) that appears to have had beneficial results for both providers and consumers.  Claims that ""government bureaucracy"" inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplace should take such such cases into account. jsh > >=Mark -- Steve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM ""One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh  the bulls**t."" - R.

The owners put out a statement few days ago, which they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase minority ownership and minority increases in management.  I think we should.  I'm encouraged by Don Baylor's appointment out in Colorado. And I think it's time to make a move on that front.  So, I think it's a legitimate issue, and I think it's -- like I said, it's an informational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to the game.  So, I think it's good. 	     Q	  Do you think they're moving fast enough? 	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that it was a good first step.  And I think you'll see some movement now.  And I think it's an issue that deserves some attention, and they're obviously going to give it some.  And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will highlight the issue.  So I think it's fine. 	     Q	  Mr. President, how about the logjam in the Senate on the economic stimulus plan?  Do you think they'll be able to break that and get cloture? 	     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't know, we're working at it.  I mean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one of the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up.  They said, you know, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  In the Senate the majority does not rule.  It's not like the country.  It's not like the -- it's not like the House.  If the minority chooses, they can stop majority rule.  And that's what they're doing.  There are a lot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote for the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political pressure not to do it. 	     And, of course, what it means is that in this time when no new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an economic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're willing to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston and Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.  It's very sad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in a hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans had always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the program were people like me who were out there at the grassroots level, governors and senators.  I just think it's real sad that they have chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep Americans out of work.  I think it's a mistake.

My hope is that people disposed to doing so would simply overdose : quickly, and be done with it, before making a mess of thisgs. It's actually quite simple. We sell Drug Use Licenses to anybody over age 18 who wants one.  Costs $100 and you're required to attend a week of night classes on the effects of drugs on the human body. At the end of the class, you sign an informed consent waiver acknowledging that you've been told that drugs are bad for you, but you want them anyway. In doing so, you giver up ANY right to state-paid medical care for whatever might happen to you as a result of doing drugs, or any right to collect welfare or unemployment should you lose your job as a result of using drugs. You'd also give up your right to drive a car. Anybody caught using drugs without a license has a choice; pay a $1000 fine and accept a backdated drug user's license, or go to prison. -- -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ken Mitchell       | The powers not delegated to the United States by the kmitchel@netcom.com| Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are Citrus Heights, CA | reserved to the States respectively, or to the People. --------------------------------------------------------------------------"	other

You seem to be saying that a LIMITED government will provide MORE opportunities for private interests to use it to pursue their own agendas, and asking libertarians to prove that this will NOT happen. While I can't offer such a proof, it seems pretty damn plausible that if the government does not regulate a particular area, it cannot become a tool of private interests to pursue their own agendas in that area. I rather suspect that it's the sort of government we have NOW that is more likely to become such a tool, and that it IS such a tool in many instances. >Just >as Marxism ""fails"" to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and >the state is to ""wither away,"" libertarians frequently fail to show how >weakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human >condition.

I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed seperately on my pay stub. While I'm not the only Canadian who favours lower taxes and cutbacks in spending, health insurance isn't on the table.  See our polls ... A better one might be the July 1st polls conducted for Macleans (our major English newsmagazine) by Decima Research ... Decima president Allen Gregg is considered one of the world's top poll researchers, and Mulroney's Conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in the face of impossible election situations.  I haven't had a chance to see this year's version due to our library, but previous ones before the Americans started their assault and disinformation had shown satisfaction at 97% and switching to an American all-private system had support within statistical noise.  The Decima polls are considered definitive.  Even the new Reform Party, a breakoff of traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly ""libertarian"" faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American counterparts on issues like these). Personally, I feel that the universal health insurance approach used in Canada, France and Germany -- paying to private health providers in a nominally free market not unlike America's, minus HMO's -- depends a lot on values in those societies different from the U.S.  The basic health needs for life are not viewed as market, but the insurance does allow the market to address that -- basic health care is not viewed on the level of ownership of a VCR as Americans would see it.  Plenty of room is left for expenditure of private funds as extra insurance or as >Lastly, there were noises about how the Canadian system was not >containing costs, but, in fact, their system is currently bankrupt.

At    least one history I have read formed the opinion that they left for the    US not to practice religious freedom but to practice religious intolerance. Sigh, see what our school systems are producing?  Total confusion! The original English settlers were, probably, the most intolerant lot of people to ever assemble.  However, the Founding Fathers (Washington, Jefferson, Madison, etc.), practically made it their life's work to ensure that religious intolerance would not destroy their great experiment... a democratic republic. I strongly suggest that those interested get some of Jefferson's and Madison's writings. Particularly good is Madison's ""(something)and Remonstrance"", [yea, I'm litterate and have functioning memory cells :-( ].  IMHO, Jefferson and Madison were the two greatest American's who ever lived. Although both were products of their time (Jefferson was a slave owner), they were able to see more clearly than their contemporaries, and for that matter, more clearly than most modern politicians. Their prose is the epitome of eloquence. I don't know about y'all, but reading the Declaration of Independence give me mental goosebumps. (For those who have never read it, I am appending a copy of it.) -- In CONGRESS, July 4, 1776 The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.  That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.  That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.  Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.  But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.  The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.  To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained, and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them. He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within. He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands. He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers. He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance. He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies, without the consent of our legislatures. He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation: For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us: For protecting them by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders     which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States: For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world: For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent: For depriving us in many cases of the benefits of Trial by Jury: For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences: For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring     Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and     enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example     and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into     these Colonies: For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and     altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested     with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever. He has abdicated Government here by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands. He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions. In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms.  Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury.  A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature     to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and     settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity,     and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow     these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections     and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice     and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our     Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies     in War, in Peace Friends. We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by the authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare.  That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.  And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.

Righto, DAN, try this one with your Cornflakes... The book says that Muhammad was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a modern day Mad Mahdi) or he was actually who he said he was. Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows.  Who would die for a lie?  Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar?

I don't find it hard to believe that ""Ole 'Zlumber"" really believes the hate and ignorant prattle he writes. The frightening thought is, there are people even worse than he! To say that feminism equals ""superiority"" over men is laughable as long as he doesn't then proceed to pick up a rifle and start to shoot women as a preemptive strike--- aka the Canada slaughter that occured a few years ago. But then, men killing women is nothing new. Islamic Fundamentalists just have a ""better"" excuse (Qu'ran).     from the Vancouver Sun, Thursday, October 4, 1990     by John Davidson, Canadian Press     MONTREAL-- Perhaps it's the letter to the five-year old     daughter that shocks the most.     ""I hope one day you will be old enough to understand what     happened to your parents,"" wrote Patrick Prevost. ""I loved     your mother with a passion that went as far as hatred.""     Police found the piece of paper near Prevost's body in his     apartment in northeast Montreal.     They say the 39-year-old mechanic committed suicide after     killing his wife, Jocelyne Parent, 31.     The couple had been separated for a month and the woman had     gone to his apartment to talk about getting some more money     for food. A violent quarrel broke out and Prevost attacked     his wife with a kitchen knife, cutting her throat, police said.     She was only the latest of 13 women slain by a husband or     lover in Quebec in the last five weeks.     Five children have also been slain as a result of the same     domestic ""battles.""     Last year in Quebec alone, 29 [women] were slain by their     husbands. That was more than one-third of such cases across     Canada, according to statistics from the Canadian Centre for     Justice. [rest of article ommited] Then to say that women are somehow ""better"" or ""should"" be the one to ""stay home"" and raise a child is also laughable. Women have traditionally done hard labor to support a family, often more than men in many cultures, throughout history. Seems to me it takes at least two adults to raise a child, and that BOTH should stay home to do so! --- Maximus 2.01wb"	other

All five schools of law (to the best of my knowledge) support the death sentence for apostasy WHEN it is accompanied by open, persistent, and aggravated hostility to Islam. Otherwise I agree, there is no legal support for punishment of disbelief. The Qur'an makes it clear that belief is a matter of conscience. Public or private disavowal of Islam or conversion to another faith is not punishable (there are some jurists who have gone against this trend and insisted that apostasy is punishable (even by death) - but historically they are the exception.

Note that ""(the celestial bodies)"" in the above verse is an interpolation (which is why it is in brackets) -- it is the translator's (incorrect, IMHO) interpretation.

Better is a subjective value judgement. I tell you a lie, and as a result you give me all your millions of dollars of assets and move to India.

So, he read what he could find in Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic. ##What he found was that the problems didn't go away, they got worse. ##Then, he decided to see if other religions had the same problems. ##So, he picked up the Holy Qur'an (in French) and found similar prob- ##lems, but not as many.

But then if you say Quran does not talk much about science, then one can not make claims (like Bobby does) that you have great science in Quran.

If you're interested in a change, here's an idea. 	Do you believe in absolute morality? And do you have absolute knowledge? Mere mortal you? And if you claim that your God has absolute knowledge, then you have have absolute knowledge of that? 	If you read the Bible and claim that it is the Word of God, and in it is contained the absolute moral code you ascribe to, but the prophets, no matter how divinely inspired are not gods but mere fallable mortals, then how can you be absolutely sure that they having heard the Word of God, have got it right? Also, you read their words in translation which invariably introduces errors of nuance and usage, and then how do you know that you got the right message? I assert that you do not, and that you do not have absolute knowledge of anything, including absolute morals. 	The only way you can assert such things is through appeal to prejudice via appeal by force of authority through yourself or a group you have aligned yourself to. >If morals come from what is societally accepted, why follow that? 	Because social pressure is the most powerful force known to man. How can you disprove a contention that the richeousness of established religion is anything other than social convention? One way is to assert that there are moral universals. But that is not the same thing as asserting that these universials owe their origen to trancendance or the supernatural or to dieties. >What right do >we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally mandated morality? 	We expect empathy from our fellow man. We expect to raise each generation with values that we live by, those which assure that mistakes we have made are not repeated. Do you think that mere authority checks all tendancies which are disruptive of civilized life? I think not! In fact authority is power, and power corrupts. The most powerful tend to think that they are above the law that applies to everybody else. Religious authority, theocarcy, has not mitigated this any better than other power structures on this score and it seems that because there are no checks on power concentrated in clergy or nobility that the abuses recorded by history are greater. 	We live and teach morals by setting an example, starting in the home. This does not come from books or authority figures in soceity. If people are weak or confused at the present time it is not because the breakup of the family has been precipitated by some mysterious moral decidance that redidication to traditional formulas will repair. That is but magical and simplistic thinking. We need to look at forces in the way we live, even the good things that happen in our present culture, that are weakening the family as the primary means we have to teach children values. Of course people are trying to have the community do things that once were done in the family alone. This may not be as effective. We need to look at this. >Pardon the extremism, but couldn't I murder your ""brother"" and say > that I was >exercising my rights as I saw them, was doing what felt good, didn't want >anyone forcing their morality on me, or I don't follow your ""morality"" ? 	Laying down the law, and with teeth, doesn't stop the crazy man from murdering your brother despite the morality or the law. It may help you with dealing promptly with him after the fact, but it may not be very effective for preventing mental illness or cracy people from murduring. 	It is quite interesting how ineffective moral authoritarianism is in fact. It may work best in societies that are already sonmewhat isolated, that do not experience change, and have long standing traditions. In a basic way moral codes decrease the number of decisions people have to make everyday. In a real sense thay allow people to not have to think. That is OK when things are stable, but it becomes a problem when conditions change. This leads me to think that morals are not sumething fundemental, at least most of them, recalling that there are values all people seem to agree on, but mutate in response to outside political, economic, technical, and cultural influiences. 	Lately, I have come to regard people who speak like you with great suspicion, especially when they include the pharse ""for the children."". I think that such people are more of an imparative to want to  control what others do and think than other more nobil pursuits, such as of the truth. Bruce Salem"	other

Are there traditional 1) If the Ninja has adjustable suspension, adjust it to a stiffer setting so you don't bottom out in bumpy curves. 2) Tell her the 3 cardinal rules are: a) NEVER EVER EVER EVER put her feet down. Not when you stop at a STOP sign, not when she thinks you're gonna crash, never. Keep them on the pegs until you tell her to get off the bike. b) She is to hold onto your waist. She should hold on tightly enough that she won't slide off the bike if you twist the throttle a bit. And (added bonus for you here), she should keep as close to your butt as possible so quick stops don't make her slide into you and knock your balls up onto the gas tank. You decide how best to word this. c) Just stay perpendicular to the bike; straight up in the seat. Don't lean your body into curves, just go with the bike and stay perpendicular. Don't look over your shoulder.* 3) Remember at all times that you have a passenger on the back. That means don't pop the clutch, and try to corner and stop smoother than usual. Be aware that if you jump on the brake, you're going to have the equivalent of a 100 lb. dead weight crashing into you from behind, so be prepared for that. 4) Make sure she pisses before the ride even if she says she doesn't have to go. No anti-women stuff here; I have a tiny bladder myself. 5) Remind her to look around while you're riding. Point to things of interest. It makes the ride more enjoyable to her (she won't get so focused on just looking at the back of your helmet), and it gives her ample excuse to squeeze you to show she saw what you pointed at. * My wife and I tried the MSF-recommended ""look over the rider's shoulder in curves"" bit, and it just didn't work. The timing of her weight shift was unpredictable (especially on the Maxim because, unlike the Ninja, the upright riding position really restricts the pillion's view of the road ahead). Next time I had her just remain perpendicular to the bike, and I could hardly tell there was someone else on the bike in curves, and she weighs substantially over 100 lbs. -- Curtis Jackson	   cjackson@mv.us.adobe.com	'91 Hawk GT	'81 Maxim 650 DoD#0721 KotB  '91 Black Lab mix ""Studley Doright""  '92 Collie/Golden ""George"" ""There is no justification for taking away individuals' freedom  in the guise of public safety."" -- Thomas Jefferson"	other

It seems >that the most stolen bikes are Harleys and 600cc Jap sport bikes. Well, I'd say you're mostly right, but for different reasons. (BTW, as of a couple years ago, the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 750 GSX's and Ninjas). Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren't ripped off is that most people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer, or mail- order types. Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily by law-enforcement types, and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep them honest about acquiring parts. For Harleys and rice-rockets, you've got 2 different situations. There is a HUGE aftermarket in Harley parts, so a bike can be parted out fairly easily. Ditto the non-sport Japanese bikes, but the prices on the parts for these are not as high, comparatively. For the 'rockets', anytime a bike goes down, the plastic is usually cracked, and is expensive to replace. It's fairly easy, then, for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike, slap it on a bike in for repair, repaint it, and make a tidy profit. The other parts, more traceable, can be used, or discarded if they are too traceable.

I agree that the desire for beauty is valid, but I think your desire to impose your vision of beauty is not.  You mention the age-old desire to somehow get up there, but ignore the beauty of the actual achievment of that vision.  You mention the beauty of a very dark sky, not impeded by the effects of humans, but ignore the beauty of the as-dark-as-can-be sky that is only visible from space, a vision that we, or at least, our descendents, may one day be able to see, in part, because of efforts that others call ugly.  One day, I hope, humans will be able to look out, not upon half the heavens, with only nature-creted lights, but upon all of the heavens, with no lights.  If advertising in space can help us reach that goal, it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it, than the 'pristine' sky of yesteryear (or yester-century), which is totally unreachable.  One of the original conceptions of beauty in wetsern sculpture was a human form, in the effort of striving to reach a goal. I don't think there's any reason to believe that modernity has changed that, just because it has changed the way we strive. BTW, there are places that people haven't fouled.

I am puzzled by the term ""concept."" Drag free may already have been flown. It was the idea behind putting up a spacecraft that would more accurately respond to motions from the Earth's gravity field and ignore drag. It was proposed many years ago and involved a ball floating between sensors whose job it was to signal to little adjustment jets to keep the ball away from them. The ball itself would then be in a drag free condition and respond only to gravity anisotropies, whereas the spacecraft itself would be continuously adjusting its position to compensate for drag.

Actually, Hiten wasn't originally intended to go into lunar orbit at all, so it indeed didn't have much fuel on hand.  The lunar-orbit mission was an afterthought, after Hagoromo (a tiny subsatellite deployed by Hiten during a lunar flyby) had a transmitter failure and its proper insertion into lunar orbit couldn't be positively confirmed. It should be noted that the technique does have disadvantages.  It takes a long time, and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit. If you want something useful like a low circular polar orbit, you do have to plan to expend a certain amount of fuel, although it is reduced from what you'd need for the brute-force approach. -- All work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology                     - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry"	other

I don't know what a ""low grade"" fusion reactor is, but the major problem with 3He (aside from the difficulty in making any fusion reactor work) is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just so small -- on the order of 5 ppb or so, on average (more in some fractions, but still very small).  Massive amounts of regolith would have to be processed. This thread reminds me of Wingo's claims some time ago about the moon as a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn't content with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth's crust, average) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though the market price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound. This prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources. On the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; ""high-Ti"" basalts (Apollo 11 and 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but... terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in titanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, and sometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are *enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the world (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If even 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2 at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti basalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the ore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being mined today).

Matthew     Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on     Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material     posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp). US PLANETARY MISSIONS     MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)     MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed     minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground     stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the     onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in     the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the     Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed     to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a     transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted     from the expression ""R-dot-bar sub n"" (nth smoothed value of derivative     of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations     of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.     MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December     of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a     very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world     with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide     (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).     MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective     shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary     space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar     panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in     solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.     MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and     took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it     flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere     much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from     this preliminary scan that Mars was a ""dead"" world in both the     geological and biological sense.     MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that     planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information     that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times     that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface     of an ocean.     MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work     done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away     the concept of Mars as a ""dead"" planet, first made from the basic     measurements of MARINER 4.     MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket     launcher autopilot failed.     MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to     orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no     other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian     surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once     flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup     images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.     MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe     did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in     ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,     plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four     Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974     to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed     Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than     thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which     makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.     PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)     PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph     the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide     new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new     data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft     had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on     October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.     PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first     U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally     designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead     studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to     36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6     through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,     and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would     have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.     PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER     11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to     study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through     1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever     to do so.     PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER     12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made     the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus     2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere     in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the     atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the     surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day     probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before     its batteries failed.     RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)     RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They     were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems     left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.     RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an     instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the     launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.     RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the     camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.     RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but     suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,     the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.     RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost     all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon     and drifted off into solar orbit.     RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send     back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact     with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras     did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first     U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.     LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)     LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image     various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO     missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our     understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.     All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were     essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.     probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar     surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.     SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)     The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar     module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the     soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered     in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing     vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was     strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.     Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the     first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images     and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from     SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,     the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored     the Tycho crater region in 1968.     VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)     VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on     a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June     19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse     Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for     Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes     found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of     its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was     pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is     pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the     thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and     boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.     The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran     out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a     weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep     functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command     had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until     further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the     engineers' efforts through May of 1983.     An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the     Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the     lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,     D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until     it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.     VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit     on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in     Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its     sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording     one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in     1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut     down on April 12, 1980.     The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.     VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)     VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March     5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched     August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,     1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and     by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare     once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to     outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,     but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.     Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their     satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered     that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and     aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major     surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous     volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.     When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets     and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep     the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive     jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle     is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was     startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.     The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,     kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.     VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,     continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly     monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was     found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational     axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on     Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10     satellites and one more ring were discovered.     In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,     including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright     patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were     discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a     canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)     The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their     on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets     beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the     location of the heliopause. SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS     Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and     Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:     SOVIET LUNAR PROBES     LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first 	     craft in solar orbit.     LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.     LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.     ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was 	     also a test for future Mars missions.     LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images 	     from surface.     LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.     LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.     ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8 	     accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were 	     unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.     LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil 	      to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in 	      1972.     LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon's 	      surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished 	      with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.     LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in 	      1976.     SOVIET VENUS PROBES     VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions 	       lost enroute in 1961.     VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with 	       VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in 	       February of 1966. No images were returned.     VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface. 	       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe 	       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.     VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending 	       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before 	       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles 	       similar in 1969.     VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet 	       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in 	       1972.     VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the 	       first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar 	       mission.     VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982. 		VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.     VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of 		planet's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.     VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian 	     atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on 	     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in 	     March of 1986.     SOVIET MARS PROBES     MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased 	     enroute the following year.     ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian 	     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.     MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian 	     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red 	     Planet in 1971.     MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander 	     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.     MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to 	     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.     MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in 	     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S. 	     probe MARINER 9.     MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.     MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit 	     with its flyby bus.     PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest 	       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to 	       human/computer error.     PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did 	       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week 	       before scheduled Phobos landing.     While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even     interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have     yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,     Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a     Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been     planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now     the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their     space program remains to be seen. JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS     SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on     January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km     on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to     measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of     which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on     January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest     approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The     geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for     a Japanese spacecraft.     During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail     passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby     will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third     October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).     HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,     1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten     once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first     lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget     satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to     orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.     The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An     apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists     to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March     19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The     rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt     camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.     Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and     performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten     made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,     1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and     fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into     lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the     approach: 	Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km 	Periapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km 	Inclination	: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane) 	Period		: 4.7 days PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES     I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three     groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,     and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means     complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your     research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can     add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.     Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it     would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in     order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in     this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date     general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra     background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good     public and university library. Some of the more recently published works     can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market     bookstore.     General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):       J. Kelly Beatty et al, THE NEW SOLAR SYSTEM, 1990.       Merton E. Davies and Bruce C.

Other works and periodicals:     NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space     probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry     these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission     you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study     some of the books listed above.     Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL     GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's     Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,     SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER     missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the     VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.     More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions     can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and     SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major     newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,     but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events     were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are     affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you     probably know.     Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you     might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space     groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their     periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe     missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,     Pasadena, California 91106 USA.     Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I     personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas     in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from     it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.
