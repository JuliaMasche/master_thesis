the front bumper was separate from the rest of the body. This is

It depends on your priorities.  A lot of people put higher priorities
on gas mileage and cost than on safety, buying ""unsafe"" econoboxes
instead of Volvos.  I personally take a middle ground -- the only
thing I really look for is a three-point seatbelt and 5+mph bumpers.
I figure that 30mph collisions into brick walls aren't common enough
for me to spend that much extra money for protection, but there are
lots of low-speed collisions that do worry me."	7	rec.autos	07/11/20 10:48 AM

Ford tried that also, back in 1983.  My 1983 Ranger Pickup had the horn at

W/r/t performance, converter lockup is purely irrelevant.  The lockup only
occurs at light throttle settings and serves only to improve MPG.  Mind you,
a converter clutch does a lovely job of improving MPG, but the additional
mechanical advantage of the converter gives you more acceleration (vs. locked
converter clutch) than its inherent losses take away.

UCC @ 2-316 should be looked at.

I think you will find that the Mac SE can PRINT grayscale images, loaded

its screen or any attached video because that ability is not in the ROM.

So, while you might be able to PRINT grayscale, you'd have a hard time

The previous article referred to the fact that you could only use 20ns SIMMs in
a 50MHz machine, but that you could use 80ns SIMMs in slower machines. I just
pointed out that if you could only use 20ns SIMMs in a 50MHz machine, you can't
use 80ns SIMMs in anything faster than a 12.5 MHz machine. Bank switching and
caches were not considered in either example (although both would help memory
access).

The problem is that the pins in the ADB connector 
are close to each other, and if you happen to bend the
cable a little while inserting it, you short the ADB
port. If you take it to an Apple Repair Centre, that
means a new motherboard (though a component replace IS
physically possible)

Same goes for serial ports (LocalTalk as well)

I think the original poster meant opening the mouse, not just

easier cleaning.

If the original poster has his answer, I'll ask: How do you open the

Because SCSI works well with removable media, and works well with large
capacity devices. The floppy interface you suggest handles the former, but
it doesn't have any hooks for dealing with the latter... you'd have to kludge
it. Plus, it's extremely low performance. AND, SCSI has gobs of room for
expansion compared with a floppy (I can just see it, let's stick a 5.25"",

Dynamic RAM is not based on flip-flops; there's basically a single
transistor and capacitor to store each bit!  Static RAM is based on
flip-flops, and is much more expensive and much less dense.  And

I think I ftp'ed from wuarchive.wustl.edu:/pub/MSDOS_UPLOADS/programming.
I have a copy of it so I reupload it there.  The triangle.txt file has this
to say :

I've recently come across a large number of TTTDDD format modeling databases.  Is there any
software, mac or unix, for translating those to something I could use, like DXF?  Please
reply via email."	1	comp.graphics	07/11/20 10:48 AM
2808	"You'll probably have to set the palette up before you try drawing
in the new colours.

Use the bios interrupt calls to set the r g & b values (in the range
from 0-63 for most cards) for a particular palette colour (in the
range from 0-255 for 256 colour modes).

Then you should be able to draw pixels in those palette values and
the result should be ok.

You might have to do a bit of colourmap compressing if you have
more than 256 unique rgb triplets, for a 256 colour mode.

That's a typical claim, though they say they've improved
compression speed considerably.  Did you find out anything else
about the book?  I'd be interested in looking at it if you could give me
any pointers.

Reportedly, early fractal compression times of 24-100 hours used
that marvelous piece of hardware called ""grad students"" to do the
work.  Supposedly it's been automated since about 1988, but I'm still

    While I don't mean to damn Henrik's attempt to be helpful here,
he's using a common misconception that should be corrected.

    Mach banding will occur for any image.  It is not the color
quantization you see when you don't have enough bits.  It is the
human eye's response to transitions or edges between intensities.
The result is that colors near the transistion look brighter on
the brighter side and darker on the darker side.

the current version has optimizations for ratios like 4:1 (160*120 -> 320*240),

No. I estimate a 99 % probability the Gehrels referred to

Maybe in the 24th century they could do gamma ray spectroscopy on

spectroscopy done.

  I doubt there are good prospects for  a self armoring system
for venus surface conditions (several hundred degrees, very high
pressure of CO2, possibly sulfuric and nitric acids or oxides

Nope, you're confusing separate programs.  Atlas was the first-generation
US ICBM; Titan I was the second-generation one; Titan II, which all the
Titan launchers are based on, was the third-generation heavy ICBM.  There
was essentially nothing in common between these three programs.

(Yes, *three* programs.  Despite the similarity of names, Titan I and
Titan II were completely different missiles.  They didn't even use the
same fuels, never mind the same launch facilities.)

They have a few problems. The biggest technical problem is the need to find
two satellites going to the same rough orbit for a luanch.

They also don't show much interest in commercial launches. There is more
money to be made churning out Titan IV's for the government. After all,
it isn't every day you find a sucker, er, customer who thinks paying
three times the commercial rate for launch services is a good idea!

Yes, there is such a thing as eye dominance, although I am not sure if
this dominance refers to perscription strength.

As i recall, if you selectively close your dominant eye, you will percieve
that the image shifts. This will not happen if you close your other eye.

I believe that which eye is dominant is related to handedness, but I
can't recall the relation at the moment.

First off, with all these huge software packages and files that
they produce, IDE may no longer be sufficient for me (510 Mb limit).
Second, (rumor is) Microsoft recognizes the the importance of SCSI
and will support it soon. I'm just not sure if it's on DOS, Win, or NT.
At any rate, the deal is with Corel who makes (I hear) a good

IDE also uses DMA techniques.  I believe floppy controller also uses DMA,
and most A/D boards also use DMA.  DMA is no big deal, and has nothing to
do directly with SCSI.


You can thank your software for that.  If DOS had a few more brains, it
could format floppies etc. while you were doing something else.  The
hardware will support it, but DOS (at least) won't.  Again, this has   
nothing to do with SCSI.

To get 32bit access in windows all you have to do is edit the system.ini...
Look under the 386Enhanced section and add this line to it
""32bitdiskaccess=on""... This will give you the 32bitdiskaccess that you
need... Thanks  :)"	3	comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	07/11/20 10:48 AM

I think the original respondent (Guy Dawson?) was refering to something
much more elementary.

Every partition (whether it is the entire disk or not) has two FATs and
an initial directory.

If you have a small disk (50 meg or less), I would recommend that it remain
a single partition. Unless you have some other consideration.

If you have a large disk (greater than 200 meg), multiple partitions can
make sense.

Someone Else, could you please comment on that. I have just bought
a Twincom 14.4DFi, which has a Rockwell chipset. It wasn't cheap
so I would like to hear of problems I'm likely to run into.


Phew, I was lucky! The Twincom internal version has a 550A and one

But still I would like to hear more of the above mentioned firmware

I did this.  I use a relay (Radio Shack 4PDT) instead of a huge
switch.  This way, if the relay breaks, my drives will still work.

It works fine, but you may still need to change the CMOS before the
drive switch will work correctly for some programs.

1. Dont rely on benchmarks. They often show incorrect due to different
   TSR programs.

2. SCSI often needs a driver to get the speed from the card.

3. Make sure the card is operating in synchronus mode which is 2x faster.

4. You can disable disconnect and get some kB/s but just to loose the mouse
   or other int`s when diskaccesing.

     No, you need not bypass the config.sys, in Dos 6.0, there is a function 
of multi-config, have you tried BOOT.SYS ? the multi-config is the kind that 
you can choose you config.sys at the startup. And I find that is very good.

I would doubt that you would be able to use the hard drive. XT drives
usually came in MFM or RLL flavors. I bet your 386SX has IDE drives. The
two are not compatible on the same controller. However, you might be
able to use the drive *with its controller* in your 386SX. You should be
able to plug your 360K drive into your existing 386SX controller (I
think). You might have to use the floppy controller that was used in the
XT."	3	comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware	07/11/20 10:48 AM

    The joystick reads in anolog values through a digital port. How?
    You send a command to the port to read it, then you time how long
    it takes for the joystick port to set a certain bit.  This time
    is proportional to the joystick position.  Obviously, since time
    is used as a position, you cannot get rid of this ridiculus waste 
    of time.  If you wrote your own routine instead of the BIOS, it
    would speed it up some, but the time would still be there.

As far as I have read WIN NT will be supported on Intel, DEC ALPHA and the MIPS R4000
series of processors only. I do remember though reading a rumour about Sparc support
sometime in the future. I am not sure what you mean by running ""unix applications"".
You would have to have SAS for WIN NT (or maybe SAS for WIN16 etc). I have read 
that MS will anounce avalaibility of WIN NT by end of May 93 (Comdex Spring). Hope
this helps.

For Logitech rodents use  the lmouse driver that comes with windows....
also you need to be using a video driver that supports use of the mouse,
both the VGA and SUPERVGA that come with Windows 3.1 will support it. 
both of these are 16 color drivers, if you're lucky the manufacturer of
your video card might have a driver that is compatable and will support a
mouse.

Have you tried setting FILES in your config.sys file to a fairly high

recommended). Also check your STACKS statement, STACKS=9,256 is a good
starting point. Try increasing it if it's already set there (such as
to STACKS=12,256, etc.). Both STACKS and FILES have been identified as

I just got Mathcad 4.0, and the manual is not clear on the matter.  On page 8:

	:
	:

* At least 4 megabytes of memory.  All memory about 640K should be configured
  as XMS.

	:
	:
* At least 8 megabytes of virtual memory....

Common sense suggests that you should be able to run it (4+8=12 < 16) but the

Hi,

If you have developed your own windows application you must have a 
SDK of some sort that contains the HC.EXE or HC31.EXE file to 
compile and generate .HLP files out of .RTF files.
RTF files are generated by a wordprocessor like Word for Dos or W4W.

If this is not the solution be more specific about your application.

By a Workspace Manager, I mean something like the HP APOLLO Workstations
have - multiple workspaces under X.  There is a window at the bottom
of the screen which allows you to select different workspaces.
It overcomes the problem of having stacks of windows open on the one
screen.  Instead, you can spread them amongst different workspaces
which act like independent screens, and you can flick between them.
Thanks in advance.

1) make sure your hard drive is defragmented. This will speed up more than 
   just windows BTW.  Use something like Norton's or PC Tools.
2) I _think_ that leaving the wall paper out will use less RAM and therefore
   will speed up your machine but I could very will be wrong on this.
There's a good chance you've already done this but if not it may speed things
up.  good luck

Zero to very fast very quickly... lastest rumor is 115 hp at the rear wheel,
handles like a dream in a straight line to 80-100, and then gets a tad upset
according to a review in Cycle World... cornering, er well, you can't have 
everything... Seriously, handling is probably as good as the big standards
of the early 80's but not compareable to whats state of the art these days.

In New Orleans, LA, there was a company making motorcycles for WHEELCHAIR 
bound people!  The rig consists of a flat-bed sidecar rig that the 
wheelchair can be clamped to.  The car has a set of hand controls mounted on 
conventional handlebars!  Looks wierd as hell to see this legless guy 
driving the rig from the car while his girlfriend sits on the bike as a

Just to inform the readers of newsrc Sony has just introduced a new DATman,
the TCD-D7 which is smaller and less expensive than the D3.  Also, the D7
has a coaxial jack which the D3 lacks.  Oh, the D3 has always been
available through mail-order houses for less than $700 dollars new... with

be immoral (in some cases).  Also, I've said that morality is a remnant

However, when I here people assert that the only ""true"" freedom

Every time somone writes something and says it is merely describing the norm,
it is infact re-inforcing that norm upon those programmed not to think for

doesn't need anyone to make it dangerous, it does a good job itself by just

I don't think such tools exist either. In addition, there's no such

So the only way you can tell a false hadith from a true one is
if it contradicts the Quran?  What if it relates to something
that isn't explicitly spelled out in the Quran?

Also, the Quran wasn't written down during the life of Muhammed

Good statement! Should we apply empirical measurements to define exact

start an Islamic revolution and create this perfect state, it takes

Tammy, is this all explicitly stated in the bible, or do you assume
that you know that Ezekiel indirectly mentioned? It could have been
another metaphor, for instance Ezekiel was mad at his landlord, so he
talked about him when he wrote about the prince of Tyre.

Sorry, but my interpretation is more mundane, Ezekiel wrote about

Wow, you're quicker to point out heresy than the Church in the
Middle ages. Seriously though, even the Sheiks at Al-Azhar don't
claim that the Shi'ites are heretics. Most of the accusations
and fabrications about Shi'ites come out of Saudi Arabia from the
Wahabis. For that matter you should read the original works of
the Sunni Imams (Imams of the four madhabs). The teacher of
at least two of them was Imam Jafar Sadiq (the sixth Imam of the
Shi'ites). "	0	alt.atheism	07/11/20 10:48 AM

For the last time, Bobby. Lack of belief in YOUR god does NOT imply
atheism. Just because some moslems aren't moral does not mean they don't
believe in a god named Allah, although their Allah may not do the things
your Allah does. If a moslem says he/she believes that a god exists, he/she
is a theist (though maybe not a TRUE follower of islam).

   For an antenna, gain is synonymous with directionality.  The only way

direction) over the signal obtained by an isotropic antenna."	12	sci.electronics	07/11/20 10:48 AM

Well, one reason for getting conflicting answers is that it depends on
what you want the ground plane to do.  A continuous conductor is a good

shielding rom other things?  This shielding won't do much good for magnetic
fields, unless you make it continuous around the circuit to be shielded,

The only explanation I can think of is that two capacitors in series

Are any of the inputs to the chip coming from TTL?  Standby-drain specs
for CMOS chips typically apply only if inputs are pulled all the way down
to zero or all the way up to Vcc.  TTL isn't good at doing the former and
it won't do the latter at all without help from pullup resistors.  This
sort of thing can easily multiply power consumption by a considerable
factor, because the CMOS transistors that are supposed to be OFF aren't
all the way hard OFF."	12	sci.electronics	07/11/20 10:48 AM

My impression -- it's not an area I've played with much -- is that the
much-beloved NE567 is basically obsolete.  If you want to detect a 1kHz
tone, set a switched-capacitor filter chip to that frequency, feed your
input to it, and see if anything comes out the other end.  The NE567 was

the phrase ""TV screen"" is often thrown around in reference to any CRT

In plain Motify using a dialog 'in-line' like this simply isn't done. You need
to set callbacks from the buttons/widgets in your dialog and let the callback routines
do the work. In the callbacks you can then carry on the flow of logic. 

XView from Sun actually supports this very neatly with a 'Notify' box, which can
return a status in-line, it does actualy ease coding but goes against the event
driven style of an application.

There is a widget already defined for GL.  It is the GlxMDraw (motif) or
GlxDraw (athena) widget.  It is similar to a XmDrawingArea, except that it
allows you to use GL calls to render into the window.  Look at glxlink,
glxunlink, glxgetconfig, and glxwinset in the man pages.


The GlxMDraw widget works pretty well.  OpenGL will be an improvement.


I think GL is a little easier to use and a little more powerful, but
that's just an opinion.  Mileage may vary.

you going to ignore that as well?

As I've said before, there's no reliable way to find out the size of
the window manager decoration.  If your window has been reparented, you
can't assume that the window you're parented to is the window that
holds all of the window manager decoration.  There may be several
layers of windows.  Doing multiple XQueryTree's until you get to the
root will work in most cases, but there's no guarantee that the outside
decoration window is parented to the root window of the display (tvtwm).

The protocol has to move the whole image from process memory to server
memory, this is the hog. The conversions in the XPutImage() are
fast.


Yes, by utilizing the MIT-SHM extension, that provides an XPutImage
derivate that uses shared memory. Fine fast.


No. You can still XPutImage all of the frames onto pixmaps (thus moving
them to server memory) and then replay them fastest using XCopyArea()
BUT be aware, this is a major server memory bummer !

xdm does XGrabServer when it's running in secure mode (so do some
screen-locks).  There's really no simple way to tell this is the case.

You can take xdm out of secure mode;  probably not too cool.

You can wrap your call to XOpenDisplay in some code which solicts
a future SIGALRM and longjmps past the XOpenDisplay from the signal
handler.  An example of this can be seen in the xdm sources."	5	comp.windows.x	07/11/20 10:48 AM

Yes.


Look up XV_DEPTH.  Also, you might want to try using XView colormap segments
instead of Xlib for your colormap stuff.  They will probably be easier
for you to use, and since you are using a TrueColor visual, you won't
be losing anything compared to straight Xlib.

Thanks for docs info. It turns out that if I leave out colormap updates between
frames and use tvtwm, my tests with 100 400x400x8 frames on an IPX using the
server-resident pixmap method give an astonishing *50* frames per second! And
VERY smooth. I think I've found the best solution (thanks to the generous help
on this group!) However, I may have colormap questions later.....

fix the table in .../X11R5/mit/server/ddx/sun/ or
use xmodmap(1).

put
  stty pass8; setenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1; setenv LESSCHARSET latin1
in your .login. the first prevents the stripping of bit 7.
the second sets the locale. the third makes less(1) show the character

Using XPutImage, your source is maintained by the client and the

I think that Mike Foligno was the captain of the Sabres when he
got traded to the Leafs. Also, wasn't Rick Vaive the captain of
the Leafs when he got traded to Chicago (with Steve Thomas for
Ed Olcyzk and someone). Speaking of the Leafs, I believe that
Darryl Sittler was their captain (he'd torn the ""C"" off his
jersey but I think he re-claimed the captaincy later on) when he
was traded to the Flyers.

Oh yeah, of course, Gretzky was the captain of the Oilers before
he was traded wasn't he? "	10	rec.sport.hockey	07/11/20 10:48 AM

I'm not sure I understand this question. When the IF rule is invoked,
the batter is automatically out. This relieves the runners from being
forced to advance to the next base if the ball is not caught. Other
than that, isn't it just the same as any situation in which a runner on
a base is not forced to the next base on a dropped fly ball? That is,
if the ball is caught he can tag up and run (or decide to stay), and
if the ball is dropped he can have left the base at any time.

He's in the bullpen. Steinbrenner is in charge after all.


He's got the talent to be the 4th starter now, and evetually the ace.

After reading my local paper today, I found out that the Phillies
started the 1964 season at 10-2.  I am not as old as 1964, but I've
heard many talk about the serious choke job the Phillies did that
season. They were ahead of the Cardinals by 15 games that season in
mid-August.  They managed to lose a bunch from then on and the
Cardinals took the division.  15!!! games ahead and lost it.... I
hope this season is MUCH different.

Probably because everyone (that is, everyone who has cable) can watch
every Braves game. They are the only team that has all of its games
broadcast nationwide. And if you don't like your local team, or you don't
have a local team, the Braves can kind of become your local team because
you can watch them every day.

This is true, but the main thing the commish i.e. Selig needs to do
is to suspend Bobby Cox.  You *cannot* allow a team to come out at
the ump as the Braves did.  I usually rip umps, but in this case,
the players were dead wrong.  Cox should go for 5 games.  If I
had ever umped a game where that happened, I'd have ejected every
player that came out.  Only Cox and Gant would have been spared, and
then Cox would have gone in the ensuing argument."	9	rec.sport.baseball	07/11/20 10:48 AM

Both protests would be denied, of course.  The umpire's judgement

Depends on what you mean by ""for a living"".  1974 was the year he led the

his career, 15-20 a year just before going to the Dodgers, and 30-50 in the

Right.  So who cares which PLAYER gets credited, as long as the TEAM

doesn't score them all himself, who cares?

Consider:

Player A: single.
Player B: grounder to short; reaches on the force at 2nd.
Player C: Double, B to 3rd.
Player D: Sac fly.

B gets a run, D gets an RBI.  Are you *sure* they helped the team

Frankly, no.  Offense and defense are equally important.  But the
pitcher is 80% of the defense.  The primary role of every other player
is on offense.  Even shortstops are a bigger part of the offensive

So true.  I'm not sure of the basis of the belief, but it was a widely

lead to it being declared to be true.  Basically the teaching on infallibility

The Litani river flows in a west-southwestern direction and indeed does
not run through the buffer zone.  The Hasbani does flow into the Jordan
but contrary to what our imaginative poster might write, there has been
no increase in the inflow from this river that is not proportional to
climatic changes in rainfall.

Steve,

If the Israelis are stupid enough to ""allow"" a second ""Palestinian""
state (the first one is Jordon), then you will probably get your
wish - and the Israelis would get what's coming to them.

However, if the ""Palestinians"" were to somehow demonstrate that 
they could govern themselves AND live in peace with their 
Jewish neighbors, then they would have to give up the idea of
Jerusalem as a part of their state - and you would be disappointed.

The tax protesters are legally correct, but they are put in jail anyway.

The weakness of the governments legal position is shown by the fact that when
someone protesting tax or gun laws on legal grounds gets a federal jury trial
(very rare) the feds blatantly stack the jury, with the same old faces turning
up time after time.

However Teel should have mentioned that though his advice is legally sound, if
you follow it you will probably wind up in jail.

Yes, I have!  Wasn't there a case of a single lion ruling all the land
from South Africa up to Egypt across to the congo?  If my memory serves
me correctly there was enough game to feed some 100,000 or more lions but he
wouldn't let the other lions hunt as he wanted it all himself.

He died of a heart attack brought on by being overweight.

Good thing too as he had designs on Europe, America (north and south),

	I was thinking about this, also. It's quite possible the
system transmits, in clear, the serial number of the device being
used. That way they can start a tap, get the serial number, and use
the warrant for the first tap to get the key.

	If they tap someone who's apparently using encryption, but
