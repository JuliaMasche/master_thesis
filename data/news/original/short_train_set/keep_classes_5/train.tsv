the front bumper was separate from the rest of the body. This is

It depends on your priorities.  A lot of people put higher priorities
on gas mileage and cost than on safety, buying ""unsafe"" econoboxes
instead of Volvos.  I personally take a middle ground -- the only
thing I really look for is a three-point seatbelt and 5+mph bumpers.
I figure that 30mph collisions into brick walls aren't common enough
for me to spend that much extra money for protection, but there are
lots of low-speed collisions that do worry me."	7	rec.autos	07/11/20 10:48 AM

Ford tried that also, back in 1983.  My 1983 Ranger Pickup had the horn at

God intended it to be. :-)  I drove two different cars then (the other an

I think you will find that the Mac SE can PRINT grayscale images, loaded

a 50MHz machine, but that you could use 80ns SIMMs in slower machines. I just
pointed out that if you could only use 20ns SIMMs in a 50MHz machine, you can't
use 80ns SIMMs in anything faster than a 12.5 MHz machine. Bank switching and
caches were not considered in either example (although both would help memory
access).

Well, there already is a sulfate process for TiO2 purification.  The
chlorine process is cleaner, however, and for that reason is achieving
dominance in the marketplace.

Most Ti is used in pigment, btw (as the oxide), where it replaced
white lead pigment some decades ago.  Very little is reduced to the
metal.

I read the article as presenting first an argument about weapons of mass
destruction (as commonly understood) and then switching to other topics.
The first point evidently was to show that not all weapons should be
allowed, and then the later analysis was, given this understanding, to
consider another class.

IDE also uses DMA techniques.  I believe floppy controller also uses DMA,
and most A/D boards also use DMA.  DMA is no big deal, and has nothing to
do directly with SCSI.


You can thank your software for that.  If DOS had a few more brains, it
could format floppies etc. while you were doing something else.  The
hardware will support it, but DOS (at least) won't.  Again, this has

Actually, they generally claim that (b) their particular interpretation of

conflicting versions of this objective morality does tell us something about

The next logical step is to deduce that any given religion's objective

That is, it doesn't take much work to be moral, but it certainly does to
be immoral (in some cases).  Also, I've said that morality is a remnant
of evolution.  Our moral system is based on concepts well practiced in

Water. Nuclear stations don't generate electricity directly from the
reactor, they use the reactor to generate heat. The heat is then used to
heat water just as in a conventional oil or coal station, and the
resultant steam drives the turbines.

The cooling towers are used to cool the steam and recondense it into water
to continue the cycle

In plain Motify using a dialog 'in-line' like this simply isn't done. You need
to set callbacks from the buttons/widgets in your dialog and let the callback routines
do the work. In the callbacks you can then carry on the flow of logic. 

XView from Sun actually supports this very neatly with a 'Notify' box, which can
return a status in-line, it does actualy ease coding but goes against the event
driven style of an application.

There is a widget already defined for GL.  It is the GlxMDraw (motif) or
GlxDraw (athena) widget.  It is similar to a XmDrawingArea, except that it
allows you to use GL calls to render into the window.  Look at glxlink,
glxunlink, glxgetconfig, and glxwinset in the man pages.


The GlxMDraw widget works pretty well.  OpenGL will be an improvement.


I think GL is a little easier to use and a little more powerful, but
that's just an opinion.  Mileage may vary.

you going to ignore that as well?

As I've said before, there's no reliable way to find out the size of
the window manager decoration.  If your window has been reparented, you
can't assume that the window you're parented to is the window that
holds all of the window manager decoration.  There may be several
layers of windows.  Doing multiple XQueryTree's until you get to the
root will work in most cases, but there's no guarantee that the outside
decoration window is parented to the root window of the display (tvtwm).

I'm not sure I understand this question. When the IF rule is invoked,
the batter is automatically out. This relieves the runners from being
forced to advance to the next base if the ball is not caught. Other
than that, isn't it just the same as any situation in which a runner on
a base is not forced to the next base on a dropped fly ball? That is,
if the ball is caught he can tag up and run (or decide to stay), and
if the ball is dropped he can have left the base at any time.

Methinks you recall wrong. Mitchell hit close to .300 in Atlanta and 
continued to walk alot after his promotion. He was then (I think) left
off the playoff roster, and started the next year in the minors where
even the Braves will tell you he underperformed because he was so mad
at going back down. 

he struggled last year, no doubt, but even the Braves blamed part of it
on the demotion. I'd much rather have Mitchell than say Mark Whiten on

That is not necessarily unorthodox.  When Christians call God 'Father', 
we are using a metaphor.  The Bible in one place refers to God as being
like a mother.  God is neither a father nor a mother in the literal

usually used because (for most people at most times) it is the less

I don't like this comment about ""Typical"" thinking. You could state
your interpretation of Exodus without it. As I read Exodus I can see 
a lot of killing there, which is painted by the author of the bible
in ideological/religious colors. The history in the desert can be seen
as an ethos of any nomadic people occupying a land. That's why I think
it is a great book with which descendants Arabs, Turks and Mongols can 
unify as well.
