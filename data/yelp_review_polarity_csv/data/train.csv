1,Also note they lie when you fight it with your bank.  Sadly I left the country to move back to England so communicating with the bank is so slow this company days in lied to steal money from me when I never stayed there. I actually booked with a better place that was not a **** hole of a place. Trust me. Same price by the airport and your in a luxury.  Don't trust this pace. Unfair 15 mins refund before you even see a room. Rooms are disgusting. Cheap and not worth 25 to 30 dollars including tax and that's being fair.  Owner is well full of him self and cares not about his customers. That's why they hide the 15 mins warning out of plan site. \n\nAny hotel or motel will and should let you see a room before you commit. So don't trust this place and if you want bed bugs. I can bet this place does. Sheets looked old. \n\nBe very careful. Go to better places. Check airport hotels. Same price and so much better.,7876
2,"Mmm... just by exiting your car in the teeny tiny parking lot you can smell the smoke of the kitchen doing its thing... like a cartoon character being led by a visual scent you follow it into the restaurant... but make sure to watch your step!\n\nThis is where I go to have a American (New Mexican) version of Tapas dining! And if you can help it, grab a bar stool down in the Basement Bar at happy hour to score the deals! I love the cozy ambiance of the entire restaurant, but going down the stairs and into a basement in Phoenix is a rare experience--and this one in particular transports you to another place and time... LOVE IT. It's very romantic and old world feeling. Sometimes I expect a pirate to come down and order a drink!\n\nI like to eat here tapas style, grabbing up the small plates off Rokerij's menu. During happy hour there's a lot of $5 deals but a lot of the un*ed options are too enticing to NOT try. The last time I went I went ALL SURF. Blue Crab Tostadas on the thinnest crisp blue corn tortilla chip I have ever had and the Bacon Wrapped Scallops. And to round out my 2-course small plate meal... I got the GCP... a side that Richardson's restaurants are known for: the infamous Green Chile Potato. \n\nIn the past, I have also had the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp... I may like this MORE than the scallops as it is not as subtle a flavor and really mingles perfectly with the bacon.\n\nIf you opt for the dining experience on the main level, they have big booth seating and a bar upstairs as well. They also have a big room in back for bigger parties! When dining in that room it feels special somehow. I love the big chalk boards that list all the daily specials... they are really Surf and Turf Specialists with SO MANY choices it's ridiculous... but in a good way! Just wait as the Waiter/Waitress attempts to rattle all of them off for you!\n\nWord of slight caution, because it's New Mexican cuisine, they do like to add heat to their sauces. And a word about sauces... they like to drench dishes in them, so if you don't like that, have them put it on the side for your discretion.\n\nAnd last, I will leave you with a story you would only get at a restaurant chain that has burning embers in its web address. I was dining with co-workers on a business lunch and one of our party was approached by the waitress with an apologetic look on her face. She told him that she was sorry but that his order fell into the fire in the oven and that she had forgot what it was (The Mahi Mahi Sandwich) and needed to get the order it again. What? Really?! Yes, really! They whipped out his meal part deux quickly after that but I still think that's pretty darn funny and not something you'd hear about just anywhere!",17206
1,This place is not very good. I quit eating here after the second time I found hair in my food,25286
2,"I've got something of a love affair with this place. It's becoming a regular part of my life now... and I am okay with that.\n\nIn the past, I would go here for lunch... their freshly made sandwiches are absolutely delicious. Given that I now work about 25 miles from here, that's somewhat... difficult. So instead I now go here after my early morning South Mountain hikes. Turns out their smoothies are quite fantastic as well. I believe the general consensus amongst my friends and I has been \""heaven in our mouths.\""\n\nOn top of that, their selection of local produce and related products is unrivaled. Delicious fresh fruit (of which they're usually handing out samples), local honey, locally made salad dressings, salsas, jams, and much much more, make this place to die for. I get all of my best fruit here, without a doubt.\n\nOne thing to note though is that you should bring cash here! There is a small additional charge for paying with your credit card, as it's expensive for them to process.",25747
1,Well we went here instead of sunset station buffet. The dinner price went up to 12 dollars. And I remember this place being packed even with the casino buffet across the street. Well the quality of the food is ok. It used to be better. The sushi was fresh. Didn't have Mongolian off the grill this time but previous visits it was good. I guess it's called lucky star out front but Yelp pulls up China star buffet.\nThe ice cream machine was out of order. The fried rice and chow mein was on Saran wrap in the hot tray. The chicken skewers were decent. Same with the broccoli beef and orange and sesame chicken. Nothing stood out and was memorable. The donuts had been out forever and were hard as a rock. I'm surprised its still hanging on. I'd pass on this one.,48569
2,"Subs. They've got 'em. The bread they use - is special, if you like it - you will like their subs, if you don't you will complain that the subs are weird. They do close pretty early, and many days they will close 15-30 minutes before it actually says they do, because they run out of bread.\n\nAlso, don't get your food to go - because if you eat it there - you get free fries with every sub, if you do takeout - you gotta pay for those fries (and they only take cash, and I mean you can't really even pay for the fries since you never have enough cash with you anyway).",67596
1,"The drivers door window would not work.  In taking the vehicle to Pep Boys, they replaced a $244 part that was not needed and the window still doesn't work.  After the fact, they told us they could do a $44 diagnostic check to see what might be wrong but would not credit the $244 nor return it.  What a rip off!!!  \nThey lost me and my friends as customers.",86597
1,"Was given this location via Priceline. Stayed here for 2 nights, and my room wasn't even serviced ONCE. If you look at my other reviews, I tend to review places only when they really impress me...and when things are average/bad...I don't usually throw stones...but in this case...I went to complain saying- you didn't clean my room...and you charge a $17.00 a day resort fee...can you at least take off the resort fee? They referred me to a very polite manager who did everything to try and smooth the situation over EXCEPT take off the resort fee. \""Oh, we will take care of you the next time you're here\""- how do I even KNOW this place will be in business the next time I come to Phoenix for work(once a year). Given the way they do business, they won't.\n\nWas not satisfied in one way shape or form. Especially when you compare it to the review I'm writing next for the place in Tucscon I stayed the next night- far better. \n\nOh- and what I found LAUGHABLE...they can't service my room in 2 days time frame...and there was maybe 20 cars in the lot...place was EMPTY. 20-30% capacity at most, I was the ONLY one in the pool. So the excuse that you're too busy- you can take that and sell it to someone else.",92371
2,"I don't understand all the bad reviews, from all the comments it seems they have done exactly what you paid them for.\n\nI have use them at least 5 times, 2 for old bench warrants that I didn't even know about and the remaining for tickets.  No points and no traffic school.\n\nThe first part is their fee, but even if they get the offense lowered you STILL have the pay the court for the original offense and the worse thing is the fine is determined by the judge overseeing the case, so if you have priors they can up the fine as punishment.\n\nI would think paying lawyer and court fees would be better then paying years of higher insurance rates.",104286
1,"I was very disappointed in my last visit to the Rio. My prior experiences there were 10+ years ago, and things have really gone down hill.  First of all the $60 resort fee, on top of the room rate was a bit excessive....and what do you get?  2 passes to the gym and free Wi-Fi for 1 device?  Unfortunately we couldn't opt out.  We brought our own wine to the hotel, and when we got the room we called down for wine glasses and a cork screw.  We were charge $3 for each of these items.  It seemed ridiculous signing the room service tab for 2 empty glasses and a tool.  The next morning we looked high and low for the coffee to put into the coffee machine that one expects in any hotel.  When we checked the mini bar we found that the coffee was $8 for the equivalent of 3 cups of coffee?  What was I supposed to do, arm wrestle my wife for the last cup?  Could you at least make it big enough for 4.  And again, WHAT was I getting for my $60 resort fee??\n\nThe safe in our room didn't work.  When do you realize this, when you are headed out for the night.  We called and they said they could have someone there in 20 minutes, and that we had to be in the room.  We waited 30 before calling them back and saying never mind.  \n\nOn to the pool area the next day.  One of the hot tubs was closed and they only other one had so much filth and grime and crumbling tile that we just couldn't stomach it.  (It sort of looked like the track on the sliding shower doors in our room....we just couldn't escape it!)  Also, my wife was treated quite disrespectfully by the people in the booth handing out the beach towels. \n\nWe will not be coming back.  Such a shame.",108413
1,Why does Harrahs have all their employees pushing the rewards card when you have to wait in line over an hour and get crappy service just to get one?  Another classic example of corporate incompetency.,111409
2,Do not be fooled by its plain Jane looks. This place has great food  with daily specials that looks pretty solid. The breakfast plates are awesome. The have gaming and the machines are ok. I will definitely be back.,125521
1,"Don't Ever Loose Anything in MGM GRAND Las Vegas..... oh Hell No!!\n\nI am still recovering from this. I almost slapped some male security staff.

All they could suggest was that I go to the New Fry's Electronics. 8:00am Thank God I have a Avis Rental... I head up the Strip towards 15 .\n\nI'll Yelp all that later...  Housekeeping does not communicate Directly with Security.  \n\nMGM Security Employees are only required to have some college....no Guard Card.. and there is some Academy.

I had to go to 4 AT&T Stores to find a \""Travel AC Charger\"" (I will Yelp about that later also). Fry's Electronic only had Car Cigerette Lighter Chargers. I bought it... I had to have something.. I was not going to be on Pay Phones....  I had so many things to do on my last day in Las Vegas..

1,"Description: Run-downed.  \n\nAfter watching O and Le Reve a couple years ago I figured let's watch KA, since it was a staple of MGM and close to Aria.  The performers dropped their weapons, the special effects were outdated.  After doing a Wiki on KA, the show is 5 years old; no wonder.\n\nThe only cool part is the inverted stage. And the soothing music.",155673
1,"Went with a big group of people on 10/20 for a friend's birthday and had a terrible experience. The server gave the table shots, strongly implying that it was because of my friend's birthday and they would be complimentary, received the bill later and we were all charged $10 per shot. Ridiculous, since this is supposedly a nice restaurant. Food was so-so and overpriced.",156094
1,"The drink specials are good. The atmosphere and decoration is awesome.\n\nThe service B-L-O-W-S. Our server was exceptionally horrible. Who takes away someones empty beer in the middle of the meal and doesn't ask if they want another? Thought she'd just come back with one but instead she didn't come back. Had to flag her down to get a bill and go find her to cash out. I'd like to go back to the downstairs and sit at the bar to eat and see if the service can be better because I really wanted this one to be good. Oh yeah, and the upstairs really smells bad. Did anyone else notice that one?",158743
2,"N9ne is almost industrial and plain in decor, which to me is their rightfully and wonderfully cocky statement of JUST how good their food and service is, that they don't need the fancy decoupage.\n\nWords will never be able to express my fabulous experience at N9ne Steakhouse inside the Palms. \n\nThe hostess even remembered to wish my husband happy birthday, double plus spec. when I made the reservation a month ago.\n\nDrinks: Glass of their house cab & a gin martini, both DELISH and served immediately so we could sip and people watch.\nApps: Raviolis & Wedge salad, sounds plain but theirs is flavorful and a treat for the eyes\nMain Course: Filet with Lobster, side of lobster mash potatoes and their special Bearnaise sauce, to die for. Hubby had bone-in porter house, huge and melted in his mouth. \nDessert: They brought out their \""Campfire Dessert\"" which is a pot on fire!!! (blue flame fire btw) with all the fixings for roasting your own smores, with a lovely birthday candle. The kitchen also sent us complimentary spicy crab cakes which we the best I have ever had.\n\nThey say you will always see someone famous there. We sat a table away from ESPN's Scott VanPelt, haven't the faintest idea who is, but my husband was pretty stoked.Heard Pete Rose was in there the night before, but we ran into him signing autographs in the Bellagio anways. \n\nI wish a diamond would have come with my steak, and I guess that's my only negative comment.....! Worth every penny (even though it was a lot of pennies :))",186959
1,"Have not been there in a while.sorry I came back, Place smell like Pine Sol real bad! Bearly no meat on the Gyro pita no dressing on the Greek salad.",192242
2,"Very tasty and well priced for Mexican food! I had the combination appetizer which came with tamales, beef tacos, taquitos, chimi's with a side of beans. The tamales tasted deliciously with the spicy salsa which is the perfect mix of chunky and spice. I wasn't very fond of the tacos and taquitos but the chimi's and tamales made up for it. This will definitely be my 1st choice when it comes to Mexican food.",195757
1,"I was in the area, so I decided to give it another shot.  This time I got the large combo and the patty was bigger and fatter, but still tasted pretty lackluster.\n\nWhat a waste of 12 bucks.",220599
2,"We have been here about 8 times now. Every time we have a great time. THe menu changes all the time, but always a lot of really good choices. \nLast night we ordered the Calamari starter. It was think pieces of cal steak ,lightly breaded and served with shaved bits of carrots and zuchinni. It was very good.\nFor dinner we had A tatse of China ,which was chicken and shrimp with brown rice(excellent) and I had the Burger with Sweet potato Fries, Another home Run.\n every time good, we are always happy. \nPlus they send out $7.00 coupons all the time. We used one last night as well. Fabulous savings. Clean bathrooms and lots of parking.",231255
2,"I have been here about a handful of times, the last time at a company Christmas dinner with my husband.  They were very generous with the appetizers for about 12 people and the service was excellent.\n\nMaybe it was the holiday spirit, but the mood just seemed great for a chill and relaxed evening with my hubby's coworkers.  No one even ordered alcohol, which was probably good because we would have been there all night.\n\nThe few other times I have been to Switch was with alcohol and their mixed drinks are really good.  There was a pomegranate and vodka drink that I recall being very original and tasty.  I think one of  their happy hours it's two for one, so ended up having at least two of the same thing.\n\nAnd any place that can serve lobster mac and cheese for about 10 bucks is always worth going to.",237876
1,"Mom is always right.\n\nYears ago my mom did a tour that included the Grand Canyon, the four corners and Vegas. The trip also included a trip to the Chocolate factory. She opted to gamble the 2.5 days she was there and ditched her friends for the casino. She told me that there was nothing to see...and she's right.\n\nFor some reason I was thinking vats of chocolates pouring all over the place with workers moving the vats with a crane and mixing machines mixing chocolate.\n\nAll I saw were employees gathered around the chocolate brittle doing their thing, another group just talking and not doing anything and the machines sitting idle. \n\nThis isn't really a factory. If you blown all your money at the casino and have nothing to do than this might fill up about 5 minutes of your precious time. \n\nThis place also has a M&M store. So you can buy, you know...more chocolate.",268607
1,"Bof... J'ai command\u00e9 un steak de surlonge coupe Baseball avec cuisson style Pittsburg.

1,Strange place... Rocking club like music with a pretty big Italian menu. We ordered the pizzas which were just ok.,289261
1,"Just moved to the area and decided to try Hungry Howies last night. I would NOT recommend to anyone. We ordered the two 1 topping pizzas, bread and 2 liter deal for 20.99 for carry out to save on delivery charge as we live less than two minutes away. The email confirmation said our order would be ready in 20 minutes, over an hour later my husband is finally home with our pizzas. The overwhelming aroma of garlic from the garlic crust took over our kitchen. Now, don't get me wrong...all of us love garlic, including the kids....BUT the sheer amount of garlic on and in the pizzas was enough to leave our mouths raw! It was disgusting...our always begging garbage disposals (aka dogs) sniffed, picked up and dropped, not touching it again. That right there speaks volumes. The sausage tasted freezer burnt, cheese was rubbery and crust was hard and chewy. We decided that it was pointless to call and complain bc we weren't going to use any comped food anyway.\n\nOverall...not happy with the product or service and will not be ordering from them again.",292571
2,"They don't make 'em like this anymore, and it's a shame.\n\nA greasy spoon / chippy / cafeteria hybrid, City Restaurant is not about atmospheric fine dining, but without even trying manages to have a hundred times more character than the vast majority of Edinburgh's more illustrious eateries.\n\nStudents, office workers, tourists and dossers. You'll find them all in here, damaging their health via the basic yet tasty grub. A window seat is tremendous for a bit of people watching, and it's the kind of place you won't feel like a weirdo sitting on your own. Just bring a paper.",301138
2,"Bit too many rhododendrons for me. \n\nBut - am I going to knock a star off what is a lovely tranquil space to spend a day? Not I, said the fly. I haven't visited RBGE since I was kneehigh to a lawnmower, when we went to the glasshouses to learn about the rainforest and the threat to it's existence (how times have changed, eh? eh?) and tried dried mango for the first time. Roll on twenty-something years, and it's taken into our heads to revisit. And it really hasn't changed in any way. It's still beautiful, although I swear it was all indoors the last time I visited! Honest! For the tourist wanting to do something not directly on the main drag, or the local wanting somewhere pleasant to picnic in the town, you can't really go wrong. \n\nEnjoy.",301404
1,"Very disappointing. I ordered the \""Pigs In A Bagel\"" (Two eggs, peppered bacon & tomato topped with cheddar, served on your choice of bagel with herb potato & fresh fruit) and I also asked the waitress \""how do the EGGS come?\"" And she said \""scrambled\"" so I just thought it was going to be a bagel, with scrambled eggs, slices of bacon on top, tomato, and topped with the cheddar cheese. I get my \""sandwich\"" and it's a little squished bagel with a gross omelette inside with tiny bits of bacon and tomato, like a drop of some white cheese, and some wilted lettuce, really un satisfying. The booth we were sitting at was so freezing that our food was cold within 5 minutes. The manager offered to get me something else so I just asked for a mixed berry smoothie to  go to play it safe. I thought it tasted kind of milky so I opened the lid and there was a huge pile of whip cream, yuck. Since when do breakfast sandwiches come with lettuce and smoothies come with whipped cream? Very strange. Our waitress also seemed like she could care less about us and I think we were there for almost 2 hours, super slow and ridiculous. Don't think I'll be going back there.",307883
1,"The chips were good,but is that saying much? I will give them kudos on their service,because they were very attentive. I ordered the carne asada burrito (and you know that's the thing I check for first usually if you are a Mexican establishment) with rice and beans. The burrito was average but the thing that didnt set well for me was their rice. It tasted like it was out the box.  This place has a long way to go to beat Vivo Michocan, Fausto's, Super Mex,etc...",310991
1,"My family of four eats out once a week, on average.  Last night was Fat Tuesday and we decided to finally try Rhythm Kitchen, hoping for a fun evening with good food.  What we experienced was anything but.   \n\nOur reservation for 6pm came and went as the restaurant ran out of menus and was unable to seat any patrons until already seated diners selected their meals.  The waiting area is unable to accommodate more than six people who are standing, so it was quite crowded.  We were finally seated in a room that appeared to have too many tables set up for a comfortable dining experience.  There was also a man playing a grand piano for the patrons.  Unfortunately, the low ceilings, loud conversation from too many people in a small room combined with his music made for an unbearable atmosphere.  And we hadn't ordered our meals yet.\n\nThe drink menu on the table boasts of a happy hour from 3-6:30 each evening.  There are also happy hour appetizers available on this menu.  I asked our waiter about the appetizers and he told me that the happy hour ended at 6pm.  I showed him the correct time printed in their menu and he then stated that the items had to be ordered in the lounge in order to take advantage of the specials.  I thought it was odd that the restaurant would place the menu for drinks on the table in the main dining areas only to add some caveat in order to take advantage of what they were offering at specific times of the day.  \n\nWe placed our meal orders (without being asked if we would like anything to drink, mind you) and attempted to speak with each other, but were unable to hear anything due to the noise level inside of the room.  We asked to be moved to a quieter location, which they were able to do, only to find ourselves in an even more cramped area.  The waiters had to turn sideways in order to squeeze between our table and the wall in order to serve booths on our right.  Because we had asked to move, we were now at the mercy of our harried and quite forgetful waiter as we weren't in his section any longer. We procured our own water and serving utensils at some point during the dinner.  \n\nMost restaurants in New Orleans carry Abita Beer.  It is a local beer and quite tasty with Cajun food.  In the aforementioned drink menu, Rhythm Kitchen was offering 2 for 1 Abita beers in honor of Mardi Gras last night.  Our waiter finally showed up at our table and my husband mentioned that I would like an Abita Beer.  With a confused look on his face, our waiter asked my husband to repeat himself.  He then stated that Rhythm Kitchen didn't carry that beer and he had never heard of it.  I showed him the menu and he left quickly without asking which Abita Beer I would like to order.  He returned with a dark stout beer and left so quickly that I was unable to stop him and ask for an amber, which I prefer.  He returned fifteen minutes later to check on us, giving me an opportunity to ask him to bring a beer that I would be able to drink as the stout had been sitting virtually untouched the entire time.  Our meal was almost over by the time I had an Abita that I've enjoyed during my trips to New Orleans, but I savored the taste.  Although I was concerned that it would take too long to get my second beer, my husband insisted as it is a difficult beer to find in Las Vegas.  \n\nHaving already spent two hours at RK, we didn't order dessert and asked for the check.  Our waiter, in one final moment of ineptness, had charged us $15 for the beer that I had ordered.  This is a good beer, but $15 for a draft beer (as it was 2 for 1) seemed a bit steep.  My husband went to the bar to ask the bartender how much a draft beer cost and bumped into our waiter.  After reviewing the bill, our waiter explained that we had been charged for a pitcher and apologized.  My husband came back to our table and our waiter stopped by with a revised check, having taken off the charge for beer entirely.  \n\nAlthough the food was good, the service and atmosphere were inexcusable.  I'd rather spend $150 on a memorable meal that conjures good feelings, not bad.  I won't be going back.",320062
2,"Yes...I'm reviewing a fast food restaurant.  Usually for me to review one, I had an awesome experience, really bad one, or because I'm the temporary Duke. For this Carl's Jr., it's because the service is great and I'm the current Duke.  Besides, this Carl's deserves their props.\n\nThis Carl's is conveniently sandwiched between Gold's Gym and Spartan Nutrition. I know, ironic. But when I'm in the mood for some high calorie, high fat, and workout killing burger, it's the Gold's and Spartan that whispers in my head \""don't do it\"".  And I usually don't.  I usually opt for their Turkey, Chicken, and Fish Burgers.  All are fast, cheap, healthy (depending what you have on it), and surprisingly good.  Carl's is one of those options that won't have leaving with that guilt feeling.\n\nAs for service, this had to be one of the better Carl's when it comes to that. Usually no wait here and the staff is friendly.  I don't think too many people eat here because it's a ghost town up here.  Don't let the look of the parking lot or drive through fool you, they are open.\n\nPS:   Sorry Carl's Jr.  I really wanted In-N-Out, but they were closed for Easter.  So, I settled with you guys.  But I learned that you have one killer Alantic Cod Sandwich.  I will be back for that for sure.",342051
2,"Amazing food, amazing service! My party of 7 was seated in the little private room off the bar, where we were served through a window by the bartender. Maybe not for everyone, but I loved the ambience and the bartender was very friendly and attentive.\n\nOne of our appetizers was late due to a kitchen mistake, and the house gave it to us for free in addition to giving us 2 free desserts! I am new to the Midwest and have never experienced such excellent service. It was absolutely unprecedented but so appreciated. \n\nI also loved how their vegetarian entree option wasn't the standard boring roast vegetables but a delicious mushroom manicotti. I would recommend if to omnivores as well, it was incredible! The walnuts were an extremely tasty touch to an already tender and flavorful dish. \n\nThis is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to and it has made me excited to return!",361911

1,"Horrible service from the bartenders. I work right across the street and I will go to any other bar before I return here. I was ignored when I got there and the most shocking part was when they asked the lady sitting right next to me (who happened to just hit a royal) if she was doing ok, but still didn't ask me. I had to ask them for wine after they asked the big winner next to me. Not 2 seats over, literally right next to me! Thanks, but no thanks. A simple \""hello, can I get you something to drink?\"" would have made all the difference in the world. No more Timbers, N Durango, for this lady!",375409
1,"Each and every time I pickup a pizza here, I feel like I'm entering Chuck-E-Cheese. There is NEVER anyone up front, which I don't know how many staff are on at any given time of day, but if you have a list of 12 pizzas on the board, 5 of which are showing READY, I would suggest maybe having someone float near the front waiting for people entering the store?  This particular night, I walked in and noticed a male worker near the front, ignored me, and walked to the back. Shortly after, I heard a, \""I'll be right there!!!\"" from the back. Hmm..ok?  This was followed by giggling and bantering about how that statement could have also been said, to which said loud mouth replied asking if Yoo Hoo, Hold on a second, would be more appropriate?  Laughing afterwards again. When a human finally appeared at the register after my 5 minute wait, she asked my name and must have noticed I was not amused, and her tone changed.  I asked her to add dipping sauce onto my order and she said, no worries, gave me the same total. Ok...   I gave my card, and he got my pizza, asked if I needed anything else, and I said the blue cheese?  She started getting grated cheese, and I asked again for the blue cheese, to which she must have forgotten (giggle giggle), and got two for me. \nI don't mind having fun at work, but don't do it in front of customers waiting, and who may or may not have had a shitty day.  It's not amusing.  These workers act like children, and this is not the first time I've encountered this at this location.  I order from here because it's convenient for me from where I live and I know the consistency of Pizza hut pizza.   If these workers don't care about their customers, I can only worry that they don't care about the food they're preparing either and I'll be utilizing local, non-chain pizza places going forward. I've also sent a complaint to corporate.  Lesson?  Don't piss off someone who has had a shitty day by making them wait around and then acting like clowns.\n\n\nUPDATE: I received an email from corporate addressing the issue and apologizing saying they would contact the store manager. I received a phone call from the store manager apologizing and offering a $15 credit to my account which is valid only at this location. I am not positive I will use this as I don't trust the workers there. If they see this credit, what would they do to my order?  Very generous solution, and I thanked her, but probably won't be using that credit.",377873
1,The atmosphere is great. I went in on a Wednesday night and while everything else in Old Town was shutting down it was open and pretty busy.  You can sit outside and even inside is pretty open which I liked. Servers are really nice too.\nThe reason I gave it two stars is because I ordered the Bruschetta. It was disgusting. Not only did it taste bad and the cheese taste old but it was oily. Made me sick for the next 12 hours. Burgers looked good though but I didn't have a chance to try it.,381361
1,"Decidedly average..  I had a green chile cheese burger that supposedly had some \""zing\""- but it had none.  The daughter had Mac and cheese that was obviously right out of the Kraft box.  Some people like that .  Other than some decent sweet potato fries, nothing to differentiate this place from any other burger joint.",389501
1,"When we noticed that there was a Le Milsa in DDO, I was happy as we could take my dad to a 'typical' Brazilian Churrascaria. However, as soon as we arrived I knew it wouldn't be typical. What Brazilian restaurant doesn't serve Guaran\u00e1 (a Brazilian soft drink)  p\u00e3o de queijo (cheese bread), farofa (manioc flour) and vinagrete? Being married to a Brazilian, these are all things that you come to expect at that kind of a Brazilian restaurant. \n\nThen, I was further surprised by the fact that there was no salad bar. Not being much of a meat eater, I was looking forward to having the big choice of salads. Instead I had several pieces of sausage. \n\nAnother surprise was the fact that the pineapple with cinnamon was not included in the meal itself, but as one of the two choices for dessert (one scoop of ice cream being the other). There was no Brigadeiro or passion fruit mousse, no flan. Regarding the pineapple, it was good. However, when I took several pieces, we noticed the manager give a negative look at the waiter. It was because he gave it to me before dessert while the food was still being delivered to our table.\n\nOnce one of the waiters found out that one of us at the table was actually Brazilian, the service kind of improved a little. They were a little more attentive.\n\nRegarding the ambience, I was very surprised that the TV was playing a DVD from Carnival from 2011. I was surprised that they didn't get a more recent DVD. I \n\nIt is interesting to note that apart from my husband, there were no other Brazilians. It is obvious that their intended customer are non-Brazilians, and that they wanted to introduce their culture. Kudos to them. But if I were new to this cuisine and had no prior knowledge this is what I would expect if I went to another churrascaria. And if it were up to me, based on this visit, I would not.\n\nUpon arrival, I was a little shocked to notice two puddles of dried up vomit outside of the restaurant close to the steps from the street. I would have expected them to take care of the outside as well as the inside of the restaurant. After all, the entrance is the first thing a person sees when entering any establishment. A quick hosing down would have been appreciated. \n\nIn review, I was disappointed with our experience. It was expensive and did not have the basic food that I have experienced in other Churrascarias.",403504
2,"Ice Pan is located in Harrah's on the strip; go all the way to the back and up the escalators and it'll be on your left. As of May 2014, they only accept cash but it's not too expensive.\n\nIce Pan offers made-to-order ice cream using a base mixed with your choice of soy, nonfat, lowfat, or whole milk and is flavored using real ingredients, no artificial flavorings. Once the mix is blended, it is dumped on a super cold and freezing ice pan, scraped, and slapped against the pan to incorporate air until it is the texture of ice cream. \n\nSoy green tea with mochi mix -in - The matcha flavor was deep and the texture was just like ice cream, soft but yet firm and melted in your mouth, but doesn't melt as quickly as froyo. It's not too sweet at all - just lightly sweetened - and no heavy sugar coating on the tongue after it's finished.\n\nRed bean whole milk with mochi and caramel drizzle - the flavor really shined! I find that the red bean flavor often gets lost in a lot of frozen desserts, but you could definitely taste it in Ice Pan's ice cream.\n\nThere was no artificial aftertaste and both options of milk yielded a creamy texture. I think nonfat would yield a creamy texture too - I'll have to try that next time.\n\nYou have the option of adding chocolate of caramel syrup or of course for extra $, additional toppings or whipped cream. I didn't add anything else since the mochi itself would make this dessert sweeter and heavier mind you. \n\nThe staff was great and knowledgeable; the older man who I think is the owner is very passionate about his product and you can see how enthusiastic he is to make it for you. I really think the positively surprised look on people's faces makes his day.",405105
2,"We went late at night so it was about a 15 minute wait to get seated but that was just fine. You end of gambling or strolling around the casino for a bit so it ran by quick. \n\nIt was a noisy place because of all the music (And for being a rockbar..country music was the last thing I was planning to hear.\n\nThe service was fast, and food was just perfect. Only thing I didn't like was the silverware in the glass jar..I didn't know if it was used or what was going on there. There was 2 knifes and a fork in the jar and I was with a friend so that wasn't going to work lol. \n\nWhen the server came back around I asked for extra silverware and she starts looking in the jar. I guess she thought they had enough in there but they didn't so she had someone come around and give us extra. \n\nThe prices are good for the amount of food they give you and it tastes wonderful. Great place to hang with a bunch of friends.",408150
2,"Love this place! My husband and I eat here somewhat regularly and it is always consistent. They prepare some of the best steaks I've eaten; thick, juicy, and tender. Prices are reasonable, plates include salad and potato option. Vegetables are a la carte. \n\nGood ambience, friendly and prompt service, and happy hour available.",409139
2,Ate here two nights in a row. Had the branzino one night and steak the next. Both really tasty. Service was terrific. Our server was Casey (?sp). She was the best.,423768
1,"Man oh man. Such disappointment. Went to have a beer and dinner as I have been here many many times before. As we walked in, fencing played on the television. Yes, the one with swords. The match had ended. We politely asked to put the soccer match on the screen as we were the only humans paying any attention in the baron bar. The bartender, Brett, denied our request and made a \""compromise\"" and put the punisher on. Being that this movie sucked, we pleaded to go back to the fencing. But with no luck, we were forced to watch the punisher. Good food though.",445593
1,"So I ordered online via the Eat24 ipad app and while the order was incredibly simple to place, it took over 2 hours to arrive and when it did the food was cold and it was the wrong order. I had gotten 4 different large portioned items for my family, all of which are vegetarians except myself, and all of the orders reflected vegetarian options, aside from 1 chicken dish. When it arrived, not only was 2 of the 4 dishes totally missing, but the other two were the wrong orders and were all beef dishes which we hadn't ordered. I called to try and see what happened in regard to the missing items and getting either a refund or a replacement and was screamed at by a lady who claimed to be the owner. She told me I was lying about not getting the food, and that she had packed the order herself so she knew it was all there....however I even took a picture of the receipt and the food provided and sent it to her and she still did not believe me and was incredibly rude. She refused to refund me any money and refused to replace the order. She yelled at me and called me a liar until I just didn't want to listen to her anymore and was hung up. When  I tried calling back they were obviously screening my call and wouldn't pick up the phone. I couldn't believe that she had the nerve to call me a liar, after we hadn't ordered anything containing beef, and the only things to arrive were both beef dishes....even once I sent her the photo of the food she called me a liar. She tried to say that I made the food and switched it out to get a free meal!?!?! WTF? \n\nI will never give this place a penny of my money again. It is run by cheap scumbags who don't care about customer service or the quality of the products they produce.",449318
1,"Don't stay here unless you are single and under 30.  You could hear conversations from the pool through the sliding glass windows and every noise (including knocks on other guest room doors) from the hallway.  We stayed over night on a Saturday night and there was lots of \""Night Life\"" all around us.  It was not worth the $150 - $180 per night plus the $19 per night resort fee.  \n\nThankfully, we purchased a free night for a charity event otherwise I would have another complaint.",453610
2,"Great atmosphere-decor is interesting. Seats are comfortable even the high top table style. Menu offers many styles. Good drink options, too!",454952
1,"Horrendous! \n\nI ordered the Pad Thai Chicken. The overall color of the dish was orange. It was less than 1% vegetables with the occasional shred of carrot or onion). It also featured lovely aftertastes from multiple different dishes. There was an unmistakable shrimpy taste as well as a slight orangeyness that appeared in every bite. Every once in a while a spicy bit would rear its head as well, but those were few and far between. The amalgam of flavors on the dish resulted in a sticky, gooey, and pungent buildup of gunk slathered on to each and every noodle. I tried to give it a chance, but i stopped once my stomach started to echo my taste bud's complaints. \n\nMy companion fared slightly better. He ordered the kung-pao chicken entree. His was more tolerable but overall flavorless. Not a spice in sight and extremely bland. \n\nI'm not sure if we came in on a bad night or what. The pictures featured here look absolutely lovely. Unfortunately what ended up in our take out boxes was only fitting for the trash can. Not even a drunk college guy could stomach their food. He immediately regretted his attempt to fill his gut with such crap.",455530
1,This place needs some work for sure! First off how do you not have the ball ramps for younger kids?? You mean to tell me they are all broken?? How frustrating! There were many parents that felt ripped off because of the simple fact that the children were displeased with not being able to bowl with the ramps. It's was a sore sight to see looming down the lanes that every young child was upset cause they couldn't bowl like they anticipated with the ramps. After having bare witness with my grand daughter being let down and disappointed I doubt I will ever return to this place. Can't go wrong with their competitors. One day not have the ramps for kids cost this place my future business.,477197
1,"I came here for lunch for the first time and can say I won't be coming back anytime soon. The food was just OK and the portions were noticeably smaller than other BBQ joints in the Charlotte. The service, however, may have been the worst I've experienced since moving to the city. The guy seemed like he was just having a bad day - he was short when asked questions, our drink refills came with our check, etc. I'm pretty sure he didn't crack a smile the whole afternoon. \n\nI would have liked to come back to check out the happy hour scene since their bar looked really impressive but I will pass on that. As for my next BBQ fix, there's plenty of other (and better) BBQ joints in the city.",478872
1,"STAY AWAY- \nBought food at window of Blanco and then went to sit at one of the 19 empty tables. I was told I had to go and eat at another restaurant even though the food I had I just purchased from  them. Seems you can only use their tables if you purchase more food and drinks from the bar. Just got off a long flight and as a disabled veteran I was in a lot of pain and just wanted to eat. Seems the $23 I just spent on food from them was not enough for a seat. Manger said \""thanks for your service but you still have to eat at another restaurant with  that food as you bought if from our window and not table\""\nStay away not military or customer friendly at all!",490006
1,"Pretty cupcake, but certainly not worth the calories!!  Very dry cake and the frostings all tasted alike. We were very disappointed and will not be using the rest of our free cupcake coupons.",492842
2,"Sat at the bar, no complaints. The barkeep was attentive! Food came out quick! The truffle fries were amazing, the ketchup taste more like marinara sauce but it was good, the truffle dip was really great! Got the lamb burger it was exactly as described!",502540
1,"Very nice restaurant, but the service sucks!  The waiters were nice, but very slow.  Worst part is that there were only 3 tables in the restaurant.",513169
2,"I found this place thanks to Yelp! My husband and I wanted to go to a place with my Dad and it needed to be on his side of town. When I read the reviews, I knew we would love this place and I was right!\n\nI ordered the Southern Fish with fries and Joel ordered the Chicken and Waffles. We both shared some chili cheese fries as well. The prices are great. For both of us, with drinks, it came out to under $20. My Dad ordered the same as me and spent under $6. You get several pieces of fish and the cornmeal breading is so full of flavor. I thought mine was great, but Joel's chicken... Wow! I wanted to rip it away from him. I wanted to order more chicken just for myself, but I was so full from the fish! His waffle was cooked crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Now let's talk about those chili cheese fries. They came in a large to go container smothered in chili and cheese! What more could you ask for! YUMMY!\n\nThe only down side is that there is no bathroom, but they do have a sink so you can wash all the tasty goodness off in. Also, be prepared to wait 'cause they cook everything to order. Which is totally fine in my book! \n\nYes, Sunny's, I will for sure be back for lots and lots of chicken!! What a great gem to have found! Thanks Yelp! You rock!",545353
1,"******************************************************\nDO NOT USE THE CARWASH IT WILL DAMAGE YOUR CAR!!!!!!\n******************************************************\n\n\n\n\n\nI am so disgusted at the way I was treated! I wish I could empty my gas tank out for this car and 2 other vehicles! I was ecstatic to know a new gas station had opened and was so close to Home! I did my normal gas fill up which became a habit for me and household of 3 cars to do here. Today I tried the car wash and the $9.00 car wash bent my license plate! A common, no fancy plate, or license plate cover. I tried to get help before I came into the car wash pushing the help button and NO one came no one came on intercom. I went through it with absolutely no help! This is not the first self car wash I go Into and nothing like this had happened. A gentleman came out when I told him my dilemma and he said we warn you about damage, I'm telling you just to tell you just to tell you just to tell you .. I haven't even finished and he is already giving excuses! He tried to bend back my plate and said to take it off at home and bend it out and left back in store no bye, no I'm sorry absolutely nothing I turned around he was GONE! So incredibly rude! This location lost $300 every week coming in from all my household cars! A simple here's your $9 back would of sufficed. I paid $9 to have my license plate bent and my car was not sufficiently cleaned at all! \n\n\n\n\nThe worst lack of service and RUDE! I wish I could give it negative stars!!!!",546422
